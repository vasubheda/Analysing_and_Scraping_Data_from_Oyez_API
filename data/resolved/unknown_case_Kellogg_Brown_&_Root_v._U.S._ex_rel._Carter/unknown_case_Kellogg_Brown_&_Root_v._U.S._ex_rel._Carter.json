    "description": "The Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act's statute of limitations tolling provision does not apply to claims of civil fraud brought by private parties. The False Claims Act's \"first-to-file bar\" keeps new claims out of court only while related claims are still alive, but not in perpetuity.",

    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In early 2005, Benjamin Carter worked for Kellogg Brown &amp; Root (KBR), a U.S. Government contractor providing logistical services to the U.S. military in Iraq. In 2006, Carter filed a whistleblower suit against KBR for fraudulent billing practices under the False Claims Act (FCA). Carter alleged that KBR had a standing policy of filling out fraudulent time sheets and thus overbilling the U.S. Government for services rendered in Iraq.</p>\n<p>In 2010, just before trial, the U.S. Government informed the parties of a complaint that was filed earlier and alleging similar claims. The district court ruled that the earlier suit was related to Carter\u2019s claims and dismissed the suit under the FCA\u2019s \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d requirement, which bars a suit if a related one is pending. In 2011, Carter refiled his complaint, and KBR moved to dismiss by arguing that the latest complaint was filed after the FCA\u2019s six-year statute of limitations had expired, and Carter\u2019s complaint did not satisfy the first-to-file rule because there was yet another related matter pending. The district court dismissed Carter\u2019s complaint, but the U.S Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed. The appellate court held that the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act (WSLA), which suspends the applicable six-year statute of limitations, only applies to criminal charges and, because the remaining related cases had since been dismissed, there was no pending related matter to prevent Carter\u2019s claim from proceeding.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>No and yes. Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr., delivered the opinion for the unanimous Court. The Court looked to the WSLA\u2019s text, structure, and history to show that it applies only to criminal offenses, and not to civil claims like the ones in this case. However, the Court also held that the False Claims Act\u2019s first-to-file bar keeps new claims out of court only while related claims are still alive, not in perpetuity. The Court deemed KBR\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201cpending\u201d to be \u201cpeculiar\u201d and turned to the dictionary definition of \u201cpending,\u201d which means \u201cremaining undecided; awaiting decision.\u201d</p>\n"
