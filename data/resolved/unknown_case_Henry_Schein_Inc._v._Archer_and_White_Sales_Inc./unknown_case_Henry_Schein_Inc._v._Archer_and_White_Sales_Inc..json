    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In 2019, the Court unanimously held in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2018/17-1272\"><em>Henry Schein Inc. v. Archer and White Sales Inc.</em></a> that under the Federal Arbitration Act, a court may not decide whether an arbitration agreement applies to the particular dispute if the parties \u201cclearly and unmistakably\u201d delegated the question to an arbitrator, even if the court believes that the argument for arbitrability is \u201cwholly groundless.\u201d On remand the U.S. Court of Appeals again refused to compel arbitration, finding that the parties had delegated at least some questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator. Notably, the Fifth Circuit held that because the arbitration agreement included a provision exempting certain claims from arbitration, the agreement did not \u201cclearly and unmistakably\u201d delegate the question of arbitrability to an arbitrator.</p>\n",
