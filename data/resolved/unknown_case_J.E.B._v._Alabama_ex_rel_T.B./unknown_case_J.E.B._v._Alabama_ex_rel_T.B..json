    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Alabama, acting on behalf of T.B. (the mother), sought paternity and child support from J.E.B.(the putative father). A jury found for T.B. In forming the jury, Alabama used its peremptory strikes to eliminate nine of the ten men who were in the jury pool; J.E.B. use a peremptory challenge to strike a tenth man in the pool.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Yes. The Constitution's guarantee of equal protection bars the exclusion of potential jurors on the basis of their sex, just as it bars exclusion on the basis of race. \"[G]ender-based classifications,\" wrote Justice Harry Blackmun for the majority, \"require 'an exceedingly persuasive justification' in order to survive constitutional scrutiny.\" As a consequence, \"[P]arties still may remove jurors whom they feel might be less acceptable than others on the panel; gender simply may not serve as a proxy for bias.\"</p>\n"
