    "description": "A case in which the Court held the Clean Water Act requires a permit when pollutants originate from a point source but are conveyed to navigable waters by a nonpoint source, such as groundwater, if the conveyance is the \"functional equivalent\" of a direct discharge.",
    "justia_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/590/18-260/",
    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>The Clean Water Act (CWA) requires National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits for the discharge of pollutants to navigable waters from point sources, which the CWA defines as \u201cdiscernible, confined, and discrete conveyances.\u201d In contrast, all other sources of pollution are characterized as nonpoint sources and are controlled through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other non-CWA programs. The CWA also distinguishes between groundwater and navigable waters, the latter being \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d and exclusive of the former.</p>\n<p>Constructed with funding by the EPA in the 1970s, the County of Maui\u2019s Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility treats wastewater generated by homes and business in the western part of Maui by injecting treated wastewater (called \u201ceffluent\u201d) into underground injection control (UIC) wells\u2014a common method used by municipalities to dispose of effluent. Before injection, effluent is treated to meet R-1 water standards, Hawaii\u2019s highest standards for recycled water. Some of the treated effluent is used for resort and golf course irrigation. Upon injection, effluent immediately mixes with groundwater and disperses vertically and horizontally, eventually migrating to the ocean. Over 90% of the effluent/groundwater mixture enters the ocean through diffuse flow, with no identifiable entry point. Reports from 1973, 1991, and 1994 indicate that both the EPA and the Hawaii Department of Health (HDOH) understood that the wastewater entered the ocean, and neither agency suggested that this result required NPDES permitting.</p>\n<p>The district court at summary judgment held that the County violated the CWA by discharging effluent through groundwater and into the ocean without the NPDES permit required by the CWA, and that the County had fair notice of its violations. The court based its ruling on findings that the County \u201cindirectly discharged[d] a pollutant into the ocean through a groundwater conduit,\u201d (2) the groundwater is a \u201cpoint source\u201d as defined by the CWA, and (3) the groundwater is a \u201cnavigable water\u201d under the CWA. The County appealed, and a panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>The Clean Water Act (CWA) requires a permit when there is a direct discharge, or a functional equivalent of a direct discharge, of pollutants from a point source into navigable waters. Justice Stephen Breyer authored the opinion for the 6-3 majority.</p>\n<p>The scope of the statutory language \u201cfrom any point source\u201d turns on the word \u201cfrom.\u201d The environmental groups advocated for the broad interpretation adopted by the Ninth Circuit, below\u2014that a pollutant must be \u201cfairly traceable\u201d to the point source. In contrast, the County of Maui and the Solicitor General, as an amicus curiae, argued that the statute required a permit only if the point source is the \u201clast conveyance\u201d that conducted the pollutant to the navigable waters. Based on the statutory context, including inferred congressional intent and legislative history, and \u201clongstanding regulatory practice,\u201d the Court interpreted the phrase to mean something between the two positions advocated by the parties. Specifically, the Court found that the CWA requires a permit if there is a functional equivalent of a direct discharge from a point source into navigable waters. The Court described a non-exhaustive list of seven factors to consider when deciding whether a discharge is the functional equivalent of a direct discharge, the most important of which are the time and distance. The Court did not decide whether the facts in the case satisfied its functional equivalent test, but rather vacated the Ninth Circuits judgment and remanded the case for application of the new test.</p>\n<p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the majority in full and authored a concurring opinion to note three points. First, he noted the Court\u2019s interpretation of the CWA is consistent with the interpretation set forth in Justice Scalia\u2019s plurality opinion in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2005/04-1034\"><em>Rapanos v. United States</em>, 547 U.S. 715 (2006)</a>. Second, Justice Kavanaugh pointed out that the statute\u2014not the Court\u2014is vague as to when a pollutant may be considered to have come \u201cfrom\u201d a point source. Third, with respect to Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s dissent in this case, Justice Kavanaugh disagreed that \u201cthe Court does not commit to which factors are the most important in determining whether pollutants that enter navigable waters come \u2018from\u2019 a point source.\u201d</p>\n<p>Justice Clarence Thomas authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Gorsuch joined. Justice Thomas argued that based on the statutory text and structure, a permit is required only when a point source discharges pollutants directly into navigable waters.</p>\n<p>Justice Samuel Alito filed a dissenting opinion arguing that the majority \u201cmakes up a rule that provides no clear guidance and invites arbitrary and inconsistent application.\u201d</p>\n"
