    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Police caught Charles Borden, Jr., with a pistol during a traffic stop in April 2017, and he subsequently pleaded guilty possessing that firearm as a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). At sentencing, the government recommended sentencing Borden as an armed career criminal, under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), based on three prior Tennessee aggravated assault convictions. Borden objected, arguing that one of his prior convictions\u2014reckless aggravated assault\u2014did not qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the \u201cuse of force\u201d clause of the ACCA. Borden argued that reckless aggravated assault requires only a mental state of recklessness, and reckless use of force does not amount to a crime of violence under the ACCA. Retroactively applying Sixth Circuit precedent holding that reckless aggravated assault does constitute a violent felony under the \u201cuse of force\u201d clause of the ACCA, the district court held that all three of Borden\u2019s aggravated assault victims constituted \u201ccrime[s] of violence\u201d under the ACCA and designated him as an armed career criminal. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>The \u201cuse of force\u201d clause in the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) does not encompass reckless aggravated assault. Justice Elena Kagan authored the four-justice plurality opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas concurred in the judgment to reverse and remand the case.</p>\n<p>The elements clause of the ACCA defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d as an offense requiring the \u201cuse of physical force against the person of another.\u201d According to the plurality, the phrase \u201cagainst another\u201d requires conduct directed at another individual. Recklessness, which is the disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk, cannot be directed at another individual and so cannot meet the definition of a violent felony.</p>\n<p>Justice Thomas authored an opinion concurring in the judgment, reasoning that reckless aggravated assault is not a violent felony under the ACCA because the \u201cuse of physical force...has a well-understood meaning applying only to intentional acts designed to cause harm.\u201d Justice Thomas argued that the reckless conduct at issue in this case falls within the ACCA\u2019s residual clause, which the Court (erroneously, in his view) struck down.</p>\n<p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh authored a dissenting opinion, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito and Amy Coney Barrett. Justice Kavanaugh argued that the plurality \u201cdisregards bedrock principles and longstanding terminology of criminal law, misconstrues ACCA\u2019s text,\u201d and \u201coverrides Congress\u2019s judgment about the danger posed by recidivist violent felons.\u201d</p>\n"
