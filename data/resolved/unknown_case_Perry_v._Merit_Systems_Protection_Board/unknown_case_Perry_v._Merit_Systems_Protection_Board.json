    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In the mid-2000s, Anthony Perry began to develop osteoporosis, so in order to alleviate his pain and to ensure that he could continue working, he made an informal agreement with his supervisor at the U.S. Census Bureau. The deal allowed Perry to take breaks throughout the day to control the symptoms of his osteoporosis, and to make up any time lost during the workday after hours with no penalty. On June 7, 2011, Perry received a proposed removal notice that alleged that he had been paid for hours that he had not worked. He contested the charges and pointed to the informal agreement he and his supervisor had made and his unblemished performance record. In August 2011, Perry and the agency entered into an agreement that required him to serve a thirty-day suspension, to retire on or before September 4, 2012, and to forfeit any discrimination claims against the agency. After serving his suspension and retiring, Perry brought a pro se claim before the Merit Systems Protection Board, the federal board that is authorized the hear certain challenges by federal employees to adverse employment actions. An administrative law judge (ALJ) initially ruled that the Board lacked jurisdiction because retirements are presumed to be voluntary, and the Board cannot review claims that resulted in settlement with the agency. Perry appealed to the Board, which remanded the case. Upon further review, the ALJ again denied that it had jurisdiction and held that Perry had not sufficiently shown that he was improperly coerced into settling his claims. Perry appealed to the Board again, which affirmed the ALJ\u2019s ruling. Perry appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which transferred the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit based on a lack of proper jurisdiction.The appellate court docketed the case but granted Perry\u2019s motion to suspend proceedings until the U.S. Supreme Court resolves the jurisdictional issue of which court system should hear the case.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p dir=\"ltr\">A Merit Systems Protection Board decision to dismiss a case with mixed claims on jurisdictional grounds is subject to judicial review in district court. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered the opinion for the 7-2 majority. The Court held that a case that is appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board and that asserts claims under both the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a \u201cmixed case.\u201d The CSRA established a series of procedural routes that a mixed case may take, including that, when the Board decides the case on the merits or procedural grounds, the proper forum for judicial review is district court. The Court determined that a case dismissed on jurisdictional grounds may still be considered a \u201cmixed case\u201d for the purpose of judicial review of that decision. Although the CSRA defined a mixed case it terms of its appealability to the Board, it did not require that the case be able to be successfully appealed to fall under the definition. If the Court were to hold otherwise, it would create an unworkable system of distinguishing among the Board\u2019s dismissals based on substantive, procedural, and jurisdictional, grounds. Employees seeking to appeal would also have to bifurcate their claims to litigate the CSRA claims in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the federal discrimination law in district court. Such a system would be costly and impractical.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote a dissent in which he argued that the plain text of the CSRA required that appeals regarding CSRA claims be heard in the Federal Circuit, while federal discrimination claims were appealed to the district court. Although the statute allowed employees to bring claims before the Board, if the Board determined that it did not have jurisdiction over those claims, the other statutory provisions still applied. Any problems or inefficiencies in this statutory scheme were for the legislative branch, not the judiciary, to fix. Justice Gorsuch also argued that there was no statutory text clearly defining a \u201cmixed case\u201d or its procedural path, and there was no indication that Congress intended to carve out a particular place for such a case. Justice Clarence Thomas joined in the dissent. </p>\n"
