    "description": "A case in which the Court held that a wrongful death lawsuit under California law alleging that Mazda should have installed belt and shoulder seatbelts in the backseat of a minivan is not preempted by a federal regulation that gives automakers the option to install either kind of seatbelts. ",
    "justia_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/562/323/",
    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Three members of the Williamson family were involved in a head-on collision with another vehicle. Delbert and Alexa wore lap/shoulder seatbelts and survived, while Thanh wore a lap-only seatbelt and died. Subsequently, they sued Mazda Motor of America for strict products liability, negligence, deceit, and wrongful death in a California state court. The court dismissed the claims, holding that federal law precluded a state court tort action \"to the extent the theory of liability [was rooted in] the lap-only seat belt.\" On appeal, a California appellate court affirmed, holding that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\") regulation allowing minivan rear seats to have either lap-only or lap/shoulder seat belts preempted state court wrongful death actions.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>No. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court decision in a unanimous opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer. The court held that the state tort lawsuit in this case is not preempted by federal auto safety standards. Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a concurring opinion, while Justice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion concurring in the judgment. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in consideration of the case.</p>\n"
