    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Moris Campos-Chaves, a native and citizen of El Salvador, entered the United States illegally on January 24, 2005, and was served with a Notice to Appear (NTA) on February 10, 2005. He was charged as removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). When Campos-Chaves did not appear for his hearing, he was ordered removed in absentia.</p>\n<p>Years later, on September 18, 2018, Campos-Chaves moved to reopen his case, arguing that the NTA he had initially received was defective. The immigration judge concluded that the NTA was not defective, and Campos-Chaves had actually received both the NTA and the Notice of Hearing. Thus, the immigration judge denied his petition for review and also denied all pending motions. The Board of Immigration Appeals issued a final order of removal, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied his petition for rehearing.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Because each of the noncitizens in this case received a proper notice for the removal hearings they missed and at which they were ordered removed from the United States, they cannot seek rescission of their in absentia removal orders on the basis of defective notice under \u00a71229a(b)(5)(C)(ii). Justice Samuel Alito authored the 5-4 majority opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The phrase \u201cnotice in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2)\u201d in \u00a71229a(b)(5)(C)(ii) means that either a paragraph (1) notice to appear (NTA) or a paragraph (2) notice of hearing can suffice to defeat rescission. The word \u201cor\u201d is typically disjunctive, and the statutory context supports this reading. The notice that \u201cmatters\u201d for purposes of rescission is the one that informed the noncitizen of the time and date of the missed hearing at which they were ordered removed. This aligns with \u00a71229a(b)(5)(A), which ties \u201cthe written notice\u201d to the specific missed proceeding. A paragraph (2) notice can stand alone and provide valid notice, even if the initial NTA was deficient. The terms \u201cchange\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d in paragraph (2) do not require a prior compliant NTA.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here, the noncitizens received proper paragraph (2) notices for the hearings they missed, even though their initial NTAs lacked time and place information. Therefore, they cannot seek rescission based on defective notice. While the government must still provide an NTA, noncitizens who receive only a paragraph (2) notice must attend the hearing or face removal in absentia. They can raise issues about incomplete notice at that time.</p>\n<p>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Neil Gorsuch joined. Justice Jackson argued that the majority\u2019s interpretation misreads the plain text of the statute and ignores the indispensable role of a compliant notice to appear (NTA) under \u00a71229(a)(1). She contends that a paragraph (2) notice cannot stand alone and presupposes a valid NTA, as evidenced by the statute's structure, language, and context. This reading aligns with the Court\u2019s previous statements in Pereira and Niz-Chavez, and the majority\u2019s different interpretation disrupts Congress\u2019s carefully crafted removal scheme, which balances efficiency with fairness and procedural integrity.</p>\n"
