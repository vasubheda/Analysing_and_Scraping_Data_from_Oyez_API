    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Petitioners Christopher and Kimberly Garnier are parents of children in the Poway Unified School District in the city of Poway, California, just north of San Diego. The Garniers frequently posted comments critical of the District\u2019s Board of Trustees on the social media pages of the Trustees, including Respondents Michelle O\u2019Connor-Ratcliff and T.J. Zane. For their school-board campaigns, O\u2019Connor-Ratcliff and Zane created personal Facebook and Twitter pages, which they updated with their official titles once elected and continued to use to post about school-district business and news. The Trustees began to hide or delete the critical and often repetitive comments by the Garniers, and then around October 2017, they blocked the Garniers from their social media pages.</p>\n<p>After the Trustees blocked the Garniers, the Garniers sued them, arguing that their social media pages constitute public fora and that by blocking them, the Trustees violated their First Amendment rights. The district court granted declaratory and injunctive relief to the Garniers but found that the Trustees\u2019 had qualified immunity from the damages claims. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>The Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment\u2014that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\u2019s state-action requirement was satisfied because of the \u201cclose nexus\u201d between petitioners\u2019 social media pages and their positions as public officials\u2014is vacated, and the case is remanded in light of <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2023/22-611\">Lindke v. Freed</a>.</p>\n"
