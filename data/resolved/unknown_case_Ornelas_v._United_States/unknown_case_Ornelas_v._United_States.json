    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Saul Ornelas and Ismael Ornelas-Ledesma were arrested in Wisconsin after suspicious activity led to the discovery of cocaine in the defendants' car. In a motion to suppress the evidence, the defendants alleged that their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated in their detainment and in the police search of the car. The District Court denied the motion and the defendants pleaded guilty. The Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed the District Court but for different reasons.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Yes. In an 8-1 decision, announced by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court held \"[t]he ultimate questions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause to make a warrantless search should be reviewed de novo.\" The principle details in such a review should be an analysis of events leading up to the search and the objective review of the search.</p>\n"
