    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corporation is a news organization that produces online journalism and licenses articles to websites while retaining the copyright to the articles. Wall-Street.com obtained licenses to several articles produced by Fourth Estate, and under the license agreement, Wall-Street was required to remove all of the content produced by Fourth Estate from its website before cancelling its account. However, when Wall-Street cancelled its account, it\u00a0continued to display the articles produced by Fourth Estate.</p>\n<p>Fourth Estate filed a lawsuit for copyright infringement, although it filed an application to register its allegedly infringed copyrights and the copyright office had not yet registered its claims. The district court dismissed the action, finding \u201cregistration\u201d under Section 411 of the Copyright Act required that the register of copyrights \u201cregister the claim,\u201d and that step had not occurred. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Registration of a copyright claim \u201chas been made\u201d not when an application for registration is filed, but only after the copyright office has processed the application and registered the copyright. In a unanimous opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court held that Fourth Estate\u2019s application to register its allegedly infringed copyrights was not yet complete for the purposes of 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a) because the copyright office had not yet registered its claims. The Court looked to the language of the first two sentences of \u00a7 411(a) and found that under Fourth Estate\u2019s proposed interpretation of the statute\u2014that application alone would constitute registration\u2014the second sentence would be made superfluous. Canons of statutory construction caution against such interpretations. The Court found that the more plausible interpretation\u2014that registration occurs only when the copyright office finishes processing the application\u2014is consistent with other provisions of the Copyright Act, as well.</p>\n"
