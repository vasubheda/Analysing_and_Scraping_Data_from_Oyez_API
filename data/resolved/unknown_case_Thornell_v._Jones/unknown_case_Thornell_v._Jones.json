    "description": "A case in which the Court held that when a capital defendant claims that he was prejudiced at sentencing because counsel failed to present available mitigating evidence, a court must decide whether it is reasonably likely that the additional evidence would have avoided a death sentence, which the court does by evaluating the strength of all the evidence and comparing the weight of aggravating and mitigating factors.

    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In Bullhead City, Arizona, on March 26, 1992, Danny Lee Jones and Robert Weaver engaged in a day of drinking and using crystal methamphetamine. A violent altercation ensued, resulting in Jones fatally striking Weaver with a baseball bat. Jones also attacked Weaver\u2019s grandmother, Katherine Gumina, and his seven-year-old daughter, Tisha, the latter of whom he also strangled or suffocated. Jones fled to Las Vegas but was arrested and indicted in Arizona on two counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. His public defender, inexperienced in capital cases, received limited funding for expert witnesses. Jones was convicted on all counts, and a sentencing hearing was scheduled.</p>\n<p>At sentencing, testimony revealed Jones\u2019s troubled childhood, including substance abuse, head injuries, and abuse by his first stepfather. Dr. Jack Potts, a forensic psychiatrist, assessed Jones, citing a history of substance abuse, possible mood disorders, and susceptibility to aggression due to drug use. Potts\u2019s report, submitted late due to delayed receipt of the Presentence Information Report, suggested Jones\u2019s impaired capacity to conform to the law at the time of the offenses. Despite a request for a continuance for further psychological testing, the judge found multiple aggravating factors for the murders and sentenced Jones to death for both murders and an additional twenty-five years for the attempted murder.</p>\n<p>The Arizona Supreme Court upheld the conviction and sentence, and Jones filed a federal petition for habeas relief. After protracted litigation and appeals, the district court dismissed Jones\u2019s habeas petition. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that application of the appropriate standards pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\") meant that Jones was denied the effective assistance of counsel at sentencing.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>When a capital defendant claims that he was prejudiced at sentencing because counsel failed to present available mitigating evidence, a court must decide whether it is reasonably likely that the additional evidence would have avoided a death sentence, which the court does by evaluating the strength of all the evidence and comparing the weight of aggravating and mitigating factors. Justice Samuel Alito authored the 6-3 majority opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>To show ineffective assistance of counsel, Jones needed to prove his counsel's performance was deficient and prejudiced the outcome, meaning there was a reasonable probability that absent the errors, the sentencer would not have imposed the death penalty. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit failed to properly apply this standard in three ways: (1) It did not adequately consider the serious aggravating circumstances in Jones\u2019s case; (2) It applied an unsound rule prohibiting comparative analysis of expert testimony; and (3) It incorrectly suggested the sentencer cannot find mitigating evidence unpersuasive. Weighing the mitigating and aggravating evidence itself, the Court determined that most of Jones\u2019s mitigating evidence was already presented in state court and the new evidence was not substantial. In contrast, the aggravating circumstances\u2014multiple homicides, cruelty, financial motivation, and murder of a child\u2014are given great weight under Arizona law. Past Arizona cases with similar aggravating factors resulted in the death penalty even with significant mitigating evidence. Therefore, there was no reasonable probability that Jones\u2019s additional evidence would have changed the sentencing outcome.</p>\n<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Elena Kagan joined. Justice Sotomayor argued that while she agreed that the Ninth Circuit \u201call but ignored the strong aggravating circumstances in this case,\u201d the majority \u201cunnecessarily\u201d reweighed the evidence itself rather than remanding it to the lower court to decide in the first instance.</p>\n"
