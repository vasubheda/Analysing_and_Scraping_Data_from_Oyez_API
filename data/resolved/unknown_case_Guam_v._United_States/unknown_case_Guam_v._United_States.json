    "description": "A case in which the Court held that Guam can pursue a contribution action against the U.S. Navy for its role in the environmental hazards arising from the Navy\u2019s landfill on the island of Guam, known as the Ordot Dump.",
    "justia_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/593/20-382/",
    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>The United States captured the island of Guam from Spain in 1898, during the Spanish-American War. From 1903, the United States maintained military rule until the passage of the Guam Organic Act in 1950, which formally transferred power from the United States to Guam\u2019s newly formed civilian government. Guam remains an \u201cunincorporated territory of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the 1940s, the Navy constructed and operated the Ordot Dump for the disposal of municipal and military waste, allegedly including munitions and chemicals such as DDT and Agent Orange, and continued to use the landfill throughout the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The Ordot Dump lacked basic environmental safeguards, and as a result, contaminants were released into the Lonfit River, which ultimately flows into the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>In 1983, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) added the Ordot Dump to its National Priorities List, and in 1988, it designated the Navy as a potentially responsible party. However, because the Navy had relinquished sovereignty over the island, Guam remained the owner and operator of the Ordot Dump. As such, the EPA repeatedly ordered Guam to propose plans for containing and disposing of waste at the landfill.</p>\n<p>In 2002, the EPA sued Guam under the Clean Water Act, asking the court to require Guam to comply with the Act, in part by submitting plans and a compliance schedule for a cover system of the Ordot Dump, and by completing construction of the cover system. The EPA and Guam agreed that Guam would pay a civil penalty, close the Ordot Dump, and design a cover system. Guam closed the Ordot Dump in 2011.</p>\n<p>In 2017, Guam sued the United States, alleging that the Navy was responsible for the Ordot Dump\u2019s contamination and was thus responsible for the costs of closing and remediating the landfill. Guam\u2019s claims rested on two provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Section 107 allows for a \u201ccost-recovery\u201d action and Section 113(f) allows for a \u201ccontribution\u201d action. The statute of limitations for the former action is six years, compared to only three for the latter. The district court concluded that Guam\u2019s agreement with the EPA did not trigger section 113, so Guam could maintain its section 107 claim against the United States. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Guam can pursue its lawsuit against the federal government over the cleaning costs associated with the Ordot Dump. Justice Clarence Thomas authored the unanimous opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Subsection 113(f) allows a party to seek contribution \u201cfrom any other person who is liable or potentially liable under section 107(a) of CERCLA\u201d and provides that \u201ca person who has resolved its liability to the United States . . . may seek contribution from any person who is not party to a settlement referred to in \u00a7 113(F)(2).\u201d The language and structure of this statute support the interpretation that the right of contribution is predicated on CERCLA liability. Because the statutory language is best understood only in reference to CERCLA, the most natural reading of the provision is that a party may seek contribution under CERCLA only after settling a CERCLA-specific liability, not resolving environmental liability under some other law. Thus, the agreement between the EPA and Guam did not trigger the statute of limitations for seeking contribution.</p>\n"
