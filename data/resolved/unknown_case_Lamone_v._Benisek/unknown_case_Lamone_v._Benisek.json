    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>This is the second time this case regarding partisan gerrymandering in Maryland comes before the Supreme Court. In <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2017/17-333\"><em>Benisek v. Lamone</em>, 585 U.S. __ (2018)</a>, the Court heard the case and issued a per curiam (unsigned) opinion that did not resolve the substantive legal questions. Rather, in that opinion the Court emphasized that the case was in its early stages and that the Court was reviewing the district court\u2019s decision under a lenient standard\u2014abuse of discretion. Under that standard, the Court found that the district court\u2019s ruling (denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction barring the state from enforcing the redistricting plan and requiring it to implement a new map for the 2018 midterm elections) was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p>After the Court decided <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2017/16-1161\"><em>Gill v. Whitford</em>, 585 U.S. __ (2018)</a>\u2014holding that the Democratic voter plaintiffs in Wisconsin had failed to demonstrate Article III standing based on claims of statewide injury due to unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering\u2014the district court in the Maryland case held another hearing. This time, the district court ruled for the plaintiffs and ordered the state to draw a new map for the 2020 election. Maryland appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Partisan gerrymandering claims are not justiciable because they present a political question beyond the reach of the federal courts.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the 5-4 majority opinion (consolidated under <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2018/18-422\"><em>Rucho v. Common Cause, No. 18-422</em></a>). Federal courts are charged with resolving cases and controversies of a judicial nature. In contrast, questions of a political nature are \u201cnonjusticiable,\u201d and the courts cannot resolve such questions. Partisan gerrymandering has existed since prior to the independence of the United States, and, aware of this occurrence, the Framers chose to empower state legislatures, \u201cexpressly checked and balanced by the Federal Congress\u201d to handle these matters. While federal courts can resolve \u201ca variety of questions surrounding districting,\u201d including racial gerrymandering, it is beyond their power to decide the central question: when has political gerrymandering gone too far. In the absence of any \u201climited and precise standard\u201d for evaluating partisan gerrymandering, federal courts cannot resolve such issues.</p>\n<p>Justice Elena Kagan filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor joined. Justice Kagan criticized the Court for sidestepping a critical question involving the violation of \u201cthe most fundamental of . . . constitutional rights: the rights to participate equally in the political process, to join with others to advance political beliefs, and to choose their political representatives.\u201d Justice Kagan argued that by not intervening in the political gerrymanders, the Court effectively \u201cencourage[s] a politics of polarization and dysfunction\u201d that \u201cmay irreparably damage our system of government.\u201d She argued that the standards adopted in lower courts across the country do meet the contours of the \u201climited and precise standard\u201d the majority demanded yet purported not to find.</p>\n"
