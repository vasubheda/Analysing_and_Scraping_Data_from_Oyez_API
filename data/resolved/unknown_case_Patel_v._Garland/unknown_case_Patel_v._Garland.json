    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Pankajkumar Patel is a citizen of India who entered the United States without inspection. In 2012, the Department of Homeland Security charged Patel as removable for being present without inspection. At a hearing, Patel conceded that he was removable but sought discretionary relief from removal on the grounds that he had an approved I-140 employment authorization document. To be eligible for discretionary relief from removal, a noncitizen must show, among other things, \u201cclearly and beyond doubt\u201d that he is not inadmissible. However, Patel\u2019s admissibility is in doubt because, when he applied for a Georgia driver\u2019s license in 2008, he falsely represented himself when he checked a box indicating he is a U.S. citizen. At his removal hearing, Patel argued that it was simply a mistake and was immaterial since citizenship was not required to obtain the driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p>The immigration judge (IJ) rejected Patel\u2019s arguments and denied his application for adjustment of status. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed, finding no clear error in the factual findings. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction to review the factual findings of the IJ, based on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), which provides that \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review\u201d \u201cany judgment regarding the granting of relief\u201d for certain enumerated categories of discretionary relief, including the relief for which Patel applied.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Federal courts lack jurisdiction to review facts found as part of any judgment relating to the granting of discretionary-relief in immigration proceedings enumerated under 8 U.S.C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(i). Justice Amy Coney Barrett authored the 5-4 majority opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) strips courts of jurisdiction to review \u201cany judgment regarding the granting of relief\u201d under \u00a7 1255. Best understood, the word \u201cjudgment\u201d in that phrase refers to any authoritative decision relating to the granting or denying of discretionary relief. Although this interpretation prohibits review of some factual determinations made in the discretionary-relief context that would be reviewable if made elsewhere in removal proceedings, that distinction reflects Congress\u2019s choice to provide reduced procedural protection for discretionary relief.</p>\n<p>Justice Neil Gorsuch authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan joined. Justice Gorsuch argued that the majority\u2019s opinion permits a bureaucratic factual mistake to have life-changing consequences for an immigrant applying for legal residency and is an assertion of \u201craw administrative power\u201d that neither the agency nor the Executive Branch endorses.</p>\n"
