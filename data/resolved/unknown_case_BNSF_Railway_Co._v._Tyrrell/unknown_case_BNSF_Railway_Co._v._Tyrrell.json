    "description": "A case in which the Court determined that the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA) does not address the issue of whether state courts may exercise personal jurisdiction over railroads, and the Supreme Court\u2019s precedent in Daimler AG v. Baumann controls a state court\u2019s exercise of general jurisdiction.",

    "facts_of_the_case": "<p dir=\"ltr\">In March 2011, Robert Nelson was employed by BNSF Railway Co. (BNSF) and sued the company for damages under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA) based on knee injuries sustained during the course of his employment. BNSF moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The lower court granted the motion and Nelson appealed. Brent Tyrrell also worked for BNSF and was allegedly exposed to carcinogens that caused him to develop ultimately fatal kidney cancer. In May 2014, Kelli Tyrell, the administrator of Brent\u2019s estate, \u00a0sued BNSF on Brent\u2019s behalf under FELA for damages based on the injuries Brent sustained during the course of his employment. BNSF filed a motion to dismiss Tyrrell\u2019s claim for lack of personal jurisdiction. The lower court denied the motion, and BNSF appealed. Both cases were filed in Montana state court because Supreme Court precedent for FELA decisions allows state courts jurisdiction to hear FELA cases solely due to the railroad doing business in the forum state. However, the injuries did not occur in Montana, and BNSF is incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Texas.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Supreme Court of Montana consolidated both cases to decide whether Montana courts have personal jurisdiction over BNSF under FELA and whether Montana courts have personal jurisdiction over BNSF under Montana law. BNSF argued that, under the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Daimler AG v. Bauman, the state courts cannot exercise general jurisdiction. However, the Montana Supreme Court rejected that argument and held that, because BNSF does business in Montana, under FELA, Montana courts have personal jurisdiction. Montana\u2019s Supreme Court also held that the state has general personal jurisdiction over BNSF under Montana law because BNSF \u201cmaintains substantial, continuous, and systematic\u201d contacts with Montana.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA) does not address the issue of whether state courts may exercise personal jurisdiction over railroads, and the Supreme Court\u2019s precedent in Daimler AG v. Baumann controls a state court\u2019s exercise of general jurisdiction. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered the opinion for the 8-1 majority. The Court held that the relevant language in FELA addresses venue and subject-matter jurisdiction, not personal jurisdiction. The statute lacked the language that Congress typically uses to provide for personal jurisdiction, and there is no indication in the legislative history that suggested that Congress meant to do otherwise. Therefore, the exercise of personal jurisdiction in this case must meet the requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisdiction jurisprudence. Because neither plaintiff in these cases was injured in Montana or in work related to Montana, the exercise of personal jurisdiction here would violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, so only the exercise of general jurisdiction would be permissible. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Daimler AG v. Baumann, BNSF Railway Co. did not have sufficiently substantial contact with Montana to be \u201cat home\u201d in Montana for the purpose of general jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which she argued that the decision in Daimler AG v. Baumann was a significant departure from the Supreme Court\u2019s previous jurisdiction precedent. Because the \u201cat home\u201d language from Daimler replaced the more nuanced \u201ccontinuous contacts\u201d analysis from previous precedent, Daimler made it harder to subject multinational and multistate corporations to general jurisdiction and was wrongfully dispositive in cases like this one. </p>\n"
