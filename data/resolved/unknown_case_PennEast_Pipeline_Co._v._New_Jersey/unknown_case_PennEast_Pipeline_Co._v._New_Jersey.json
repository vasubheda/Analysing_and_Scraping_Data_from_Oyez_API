    "description": "A case in which the Court held that the Natural Gas Act delegates to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission certificate-holders the authority to exercise the federal government\u2019s eminent-domain power to condemn land in which a state claims an interest, and that it abrogates state sovereign immunity in such cases.",
    "justia_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/594/19-1039/",
    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>The Natural Gas Act (NGA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 717\u2013717Z, permits private companies to exercise the federal government\u2019s power to take property by eminent domain, subject to certain jurisdictional requirements. PennEast Pipeline Co. obtained federal approval to build a pipeline through Pennsylvania and New Jersey and sued under the NGA to gain access to the properties along the pipeline route, of which the State of New Jersey owns 42. New Jersey sought dismissal of PennEast\u2019s lawsuits for lack of jurisdiction based on the state\u2019s sovereign immunity and, separately, because PennEast failed to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of the NGA.</p>\n<p>The district court ruled in favor of PennEast and granted a preliminary injunctive relief for immediate access to the properties. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated, finding that while the NGA delegates the federal government\u2019s eminent-domain power, it does not abrogate state sovereign immunity. PennEast\u2019s lawsuits are thus barred by Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Section 717(h) of the Natural Gas Act authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to delegate to a private company the power to condemn all necessary rights-of-way, whether owned by private parties or states. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the 5-4 majority opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>States are generally immune from lawsuits unless they have consented or Congress has abrogated their immunity. With respect to the federal eminent domain power, the states waived their sovereign immunity when they ratified the Constitution. That power carries with it the ability to condemn property in court. Because the Natural Gas Act delegates the federal eminent domain power to private parties, those parties can initiate condemnation proceedings, including against state-owned property. This understanding is consistent with the nation\u2019s history and the Court\u2019s precedents. Thus, PennEast\u2019s condemnation of New Jersey land to build the pipeline does not offend state sovereignty.</p>\n<p>Justice Neil Gorsuch authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Clarence Thomas joined. Joining Justice Barrett\u2019s dissenting opinion in full, Justice Gorsuch added only a clarification that states have two federal-law immunities from suit: structural immunity and Eleventh Amendment immunity. The lower court should consider whether either type of immunity bars the suit.</p>\n<p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Thomas, Kagan, and Gorsuch joined. Justice Barrett argued that Congress\u2019s power to strip states of their sovereign immunity is extremely limited, and there is no reason to treat private condemnation actions as within one of those limited exceptions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n"
