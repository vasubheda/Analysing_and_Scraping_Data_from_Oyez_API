    "description": "A case in which the Court held that to trigger the stop-time rule under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, a notice to appear must be a single document containing all the information about an individual\u2019s removal hearing.",

    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Agusto Niz-Chavez, a Guatemalan native and citizen, came to the United States without inspection in 2005. On March 26, 2013, he was served with a notice to appear before an immigration judge at a date and time to be determined later, and approximately two months later, on May 29, 2013, he received a notice of hearing in removal proceedings. Niz-Chavez made an appearance at the hearing on June 25, 2013, where he conceded removability and stated his intent to seek withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p>After a hearing on the merits, the immigration judge denied both applications, and Niz-Chaves appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals. In addition to challenging the immigration judge\u2019s conclusions, Niz-Chavez asked the Board to remand the case in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decision in Pereira v. Sessions, in which the Court held that a notice to appear that does not include the specific time and place of the noncitizen's removal proceedings does not trigger the stop-time rule under \u00a71229(a) of the INA. Niz-Chavez argued that under Pereira, he was now eligible for cancellation because of the deficiency of the notice to appear he received. The Board affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s decision and denied the motion to remand, finding that Niz-Chavez was not eligible for cancellation under Pereira. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit denied Niz-Chavez\u2019s petition for review of each of the challenged decisions by the Board.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>The government must serve a single document that includes all the required information for the notice to appear to trigger the IIRIRA\u2019s stop-time rule. Justice Neil Gorsuch authored the 6-3 majority opinion.</p>\n<p>Section 1229b(d)(1) states that the stop-time rule is triggered \u201cwhen the alien is served a notice to appear under section 1229(a),\u201d and Section 1229(a) states that \u201cwritten notice...shall be given...to the alien...specifying\u201d the time and place of his hearing, among other listed items. The singular article \u201ca\u201d (as in \u201ca notice\u201d) means, to an ordinary reader, a single document containing the required information, not a series of such document with the information spread across them.</p>\n<p>The IIRIRA\u2019s statutory structure confirms this interpretation. For example, it refers to \u201cthe Notice\u201d and \u201cthe time of the notice\u201d in other nearby provisions (emphasis added). Its history, too, supports this reading. In passing the IIRIRA, the Congress intentionally changed the law from authorizing the government \u201cto specify the time and place for an alien\u2019s hearing \u2018in the order to show cause or otherwise\u2019\u201d to requiring that the \u201ctime and place information...be included in a notice to appear, not \u2018or otherwise.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh authored a dissenting opinion, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, arguing that the government\u2019s provision of notice in two documents, as was the case here, should be sufficient to trigger the stop-time rule.</p>\n"
