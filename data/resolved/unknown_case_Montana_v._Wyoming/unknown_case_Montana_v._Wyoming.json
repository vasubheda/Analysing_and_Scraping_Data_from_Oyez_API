    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>The Yellowstone River Compact is an interstate compact to which Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming are parties. The Compact was ratified in 1950, and went into effect in 1951, in order to provide for an equitable division and apportionment of the waters of the Yellowstone River and its tributaries and encourage mutually beneficial development and cooperation between the three states. Among other things, the Compact serves to protect the appropriative rights that existed before 1950 among the three states.</p>\n<p>In 2004, Wyoming reduced the volume of water available at the state line between Wyoming and Montana by 1300 acre feet, and by 56 acre feet in 2006. Montana invoked the Supreme Court\u2019s original jurisdiction over disputes among states.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n",
