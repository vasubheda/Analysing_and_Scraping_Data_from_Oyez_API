    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>The facts giving rise to this case are not immediately relevant to the issue on which the Court ruled.\u00a0Aileen Rizo, an employee of the Fresno County Office of\u00a0Education, filed a lawsuit against the superintendent of\u00a0schools, claiming, among other things, that the county was\u00a0violating the Equal Pay Act of 1963. The district court denied the county's motion for summary judgment, and a panel of the Ninth Circuit vacated the lower court's decision on the basis of binding Ninth Circuit precedent interpreting the statute. The Ninth Circuit granted a rehearing en banc and issued an opinion authored by Judge Stephen Reinhardt with a new, purportedly binding interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p>Judge Reinhardt died after he had finished writing the opinion but 11 days before it was officially filed. Without Judge Reinhardt, the opinion authored by him would have been approved by only 5 of the 10 judges sitting en banc, and those judges concurred on the judgment but not the reasoning.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>In a per curiam (unsigned) opinion issued without argument, the Court vacated the decision below and remanded it for further proceedings. The Court found that as a general rule, \"a judge may change\u00a0his or her position up to the very moment when a decision is released.\" Because at the time\u00a0the Ninth\u00a0Circuit issued its opinion in this case, Judge Reinhardt had died (and thus was no longer an active judge),\u00a0he lacked the authority to participate in\u00a0the en banc court\u2019s decision at the time it was rendered.</p>\n<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor concurred in the judgment but did not write separately.</p>\n"
