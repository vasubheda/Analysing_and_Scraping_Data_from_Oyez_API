    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Petitioner Romag Fasteners, Inc., sells magnetic snap fasteners for use in wallets, handbags, and other leather goods. Respondent Fossil designs, markets, and distributes fashion accessories, including handbags and small leather goods. In 2002, Fossil and Romag entered into an agreement to use Romag fasteners in Fossil\u2019s products, and Fossil\u2019s manufacturers purchased tens of thousands of Romag fasteners between 2002 and 2008. In 2010, the president of Romag discovered that certain Fossil handbags sold in the United States contained counterfeit snaps bearing the Romag mark. Romag sued Fossil in 2010 for patent and trademark infringement. Romag alleged that Fossil knowingly adopted and used the Romag mark without Romag\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p>A jury found that Fossil had infringed Romag\u2019s trademark and patents but that none of the violations were willful. The jury awarded Romag trademark damages under two theories: over $90,000 in profits \u201cto prevent unjust enrichment\u201d and over $6.7 million in profits \u201cto deter future trademark infringement.\u201d For the latter award, the jury found that Fossil had acted with \u201ccallous disregard\u201d for Romag\u2019s trademark rights. However, the district court struck the jury\u2019s award, finding that \u201ca finding of willfulness remains a requirement for an award of defendants\u2019 profits in this Circuit.\u201d On appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed, finding that within the Second Circuit, a showing of willfulness was required for an award of profits. Romag petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. In light of its decision in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2016/15-927\"><em>SCA Hygiene Products Aktiebolag v. First Quality Baby Products, LLC</em>, 580 U.S. __ (2017)</a>, that affected the patent infringement claims in this case, the Court granted the petition, vacated the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision, and remanded the case. On remand, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed the district court\u2019s judgment declining to award Fossil\u2019s profits.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Section 35 of the Lanham Act does not require a plaintiff in a trademark infringement suit to show that a defendant willfully infringed the plaintiff\u2019s trademark as a precondition to an award of profits. Justice Neil Gorsuch authored the opinion of the Court on behalf of the 8-1 majority.</p>\n<p>The plain language of Section 35 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a) does not require a plaintiff alleging a claim under \u00a7 1125(a) to show willfulness. Rather, the statute mentions \u201cwillfulness\u201d only in connection to \u00a7 1125(c). The Court declined to read into the statute words that are not there, particularly since Congress included the term \u201cwillfulness\u201d elsewhere in the very same statutory provision.</p>\n<p>Justice Samuel Alito authored a concurring opinion, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan to note that while willfulness is a \u201chighly important\u201d consideration in awarding profits under Section 35 of the Lanham Act, it is not an \u201cabsolute precondition.\u201d</p>\n<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor authored an opinion concurring in the judgment, to highlight a distinction, supported by the weight of authority, between \u201cwillful\u201d infringement and \u201cinnocent\u201d infringement\u2014a distinction she criticizes the majority of being \u201cagnostic\u201d about.</p>\n"
