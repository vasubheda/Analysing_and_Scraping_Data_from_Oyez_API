    "description": "A case in which the Court held that an unemancipated minor cannot use his or her parent's years of residency to fulfill the requirements for having a removal from the country stayed under 8 U.S. C. 1229(a).",
    "justia_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/566/583/",
    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Carlos Martinez Gutierrez, a native and citizen of Mexico, applied to an immigration judge for cancellation of his removal from the United States. The government appealed and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) sustained the government's appeal. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted Gutierrez's petition for review of the BIA's decision and remanded to the BIA to allow it to reconsider his case based on the Ninth Circuit's decision in Mercado Zazueta v. Holder, 580 F.3d 1102 (9th Cir. 2009). That case held that \"[f]or purposes of satisfying the five years of lawful permanent residence required under 8 U.S.C. 1229b(a)(1), a parent's status as a lawful permanent resident is imputed to the unemancipated minor children residing with the parent.\"</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>No and no. Justice Elena Kagan, writing for a unanimous Court, reversed the Ninth Circuit and remanded. The Court held that the BIA reasonably construed 8 U.S. C. 1229(a) to require each alien seeking cancellation of removal to fulfill the residency requirements on their own. An unemancipated minor cannot use his or her parent's years of residency to fulfill the requirements. The Court did not decide if another construction of the statute is possible because the BIA's construction was permissible.</p>\n"
