    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Alaska law imposes certain limits on political contributions. Specifically, it limits contributions made by individuals to political candidates, contributions made by individuals to election-related groups, political party-to-candidate contributions, and the total funds a\u00a0candidate may receive from out-of-state residents.</p>\n<p>Three individuals and a division of the Alaska Republican Party challenged these four provisions, arguing that they violate the First Amendment. The district court upheld all four provisions. On appeal, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the individual-to-candidate and individual-to-group limits, as well as the political-party-to-candidate limit. However, it reversed as to the out-of-state resident limit. The court reasoned that the first three limits are narrowly tailored to prevent actual or the appearance of quid pro quo corruption and thus do not impermissibly infringe constitutional rights. In contrast,\u00a0 the nonresident limit does not target an \u201cimportant state interest\u201d and therefore violates the First Amendment.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>In a per curiam (unsigned) opinion issued without oral argument, the Court vacated the judgment of the Ninth Circuit below and remanded the case to the appellate court to consider whether Alaska\u2019s political contribution limits are consistent with the Court\u2019s First Amendment precedents.</p>\n<p>The Court noted that the Ninth Circuit, in reaching its decision, did not apply <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2005/04-1528\"><em>Randall v. Sorrell</em>, 548 U.S. 230 (2006)</a>, in which the Court invalidated a Vermont law that limited individual contributions. In that case, the Court identified several \u201cdanger signs\u201d about Vermont\u2019s law that warranted closer review. Alaska\u2019s limit on campaign contributions shares some of those characteristics, specifically the relatively low amounts of the limits and their failure to adjust for inflation.</p>\n<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg authored a separate statement noting that Alaska\u2019s law lacks certain features the Court found troubling in Vermont\u2019s contribution limits in <em>Randall</em>.\u00a0</p>\n"
