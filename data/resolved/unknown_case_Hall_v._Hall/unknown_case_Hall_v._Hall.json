    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Ethlyn Hall, an elderly landowner in the Virgin Islands, filed suit against her son when she grew\u00a0dissatisfied with his actions as her attorney. After Ethlyn passed away, one of her daughters, Elsa Hall, served as personal representative of the estate (the \u201cEstate\u201d) and continued to press Ethlyn\u2019s claims against Samuel. Samuel brought claims of his own against Elsa in a separate proceeding. He argued that Elsa had poisoned his relationship with his mother, which caused him serious emotional distress. The Estate\u2019s claims and Samuel\u2019s claims were consolidated and tried together. A jury rejected the Estate\u2019s claims and rendered a two million dollar verdict in Samuel\u2019s favor. The District Court entered separate judgments on both aspects of the\u00a0jury\u2019s decision.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Estate appealed the judgment with respect to its claims, but did not appeal the judgment in favor of Samuel because the district court vacated the jury verdict and his claims were still awaiting retrial. Samuel argue that the appellate court does not have jurisdiction over this appeal while his claims were still pending in the district court, and the Third Circuit agreed.</p>\n<p>The Third Circuit relied on its binding precedent in <em>Bergman v. City of Atlantic City</em>, which held that when two cases have been consolidated for all purposes, a final decision on one set of claims is generally not appealable while the second set remains pending. The Estate argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gelboim v. Bank of America Corp.</em> affirming the appealability of final judgment in a case that was part of a multi-district litigation should dictate the outcome of the case and permit the exercise of jurisdiction over the claims that have a final judgment.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>In an opinion written by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court unanimously held that when one of multiple cases consolidated under FRCP 42(a) is finally decided, that ruling confers upon the losing party the right to immediate appeal regardless of whether any of the other consolidated cases are still pending.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because the meaning of the term \u201cconsolidate\u201d as used in Rule 42(a) was ambiguous, the Court examined its legal lineage and concluded that it extended back at least to the first federal consolidation statute, enacted in 1813. Pursuant to that history, the Court found it to be clear that an individual case consolidated under the Rule maintains its independent character, at least to the extent that it is appealable when it is finally resolved, whether or not proceedings are ongoing in the other consolidated cases.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Court also explained that under the consolidation statute that was in place for 125 years before Rule 42(a) was enacted, consolidation was a case management tool rather than a means of completely merging the consolidated cases into one, meaning that prior to Rule 42(a), a final judgment in a single case was immediately appealable. Because Rule 42(a) was explicitly modeled on the consolidation statute, and the term \u201cconsolidate\u201d used therein is ambiguous, the term presumably carries forward the same meaning it had under the old statute.</p>\n<p>The Court rejected the argument that the term \u201cconsolidate\u201d took on a new meaning under Rule 42(a), namely that it permitted consolidation for either limited or all purposes. It also explained that the Federal Rules Advisory Committee would not have silently changed the meaning of a term that had been in use pursuant to a long-term, settled understanding.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court stated that it was not creating a rule that a district court could not consolidate a group of cases for all purposes, but it reiterated that in this context, cases retain their individual identities to the extent that final judgments in any specific case are immediately appealable.</p>\n"
