    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Petitioner Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) sued the University of North Carolina (UNC) over its admissions process, alleging that the process violates the Fourteenth Amendment by using race as a factor in admissions. UNC admits that it uses race as one of many factors in its admissions process but argues that its process adheres to the requirements for race-based admissions outlined in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Grutter v. Bollinger.</p>\n<p>After an eight-day bench trial and litigation that spanned nearly seven years, the district court ruled that UNC\u2019s admissions policy survived strict scrutiny and was consistent with Grutter v. Bollinger. SFFA appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit agreed to hold the case in abeyance after the U.S. Supreme Court granted review.</p>\n<p>The case was originally consolidated for oral argument with a similar case challenging the admissions policies at Harvard University under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but the Court subsequently severed the two cases.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>The University of North Carolina admissions program violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u00a0Chief Justice John Roberts authored the 6-3 majority opinion.</p>\n<p>First the Court concluded that Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) had organizational standing because is a voluntary membership organization with identifable members who support its mission and whom SFFA represents in good faith.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Second, while the original purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause was to ensure that laws apply equally to everyone, regardless of race, both the Supreme Court and the nation failed to uphold this principle, most notably in Plessy v. Ferguson, which sanctioned \u201cseparate but equal\u201d facilities. However, the landmark case Brown v. Board of Education overturned this, and the equal protection principle has since expanded to various areas of life. Any exceptions to equal protection must satisfy \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d; that is, the government must show that the racial classification serves a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.</p>\n<p>In Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, Justice Lewis Powell\u2019s opinion became the touchstone for evaluating the constitutionality of race-based admissions, reasoning that diversity in the student body could be a \u201ccompelling state interest,\u201d but that race could only be used as a \u201cplus\u201d in admissions and not as a quota. In Grutter v. Bollinger, the Court adopted Powell's viewpoint, while also setting limits to ensure race-based admissions did not result in stereotyping or harm to non-minority applicants, and stating that such race-based programs should eventually come to an end.</p>\n<p>Harvard\u2019s (and UNC\u2019s, in the consolidated case) race-based admissions systems fail to meet the strict scrutiny, non-stereotyping, and termination criteria established by Grutter and Bakke. Specifically, the universities could not demonstrate their compelling interests in a measurable way, failed to avoid racial stereotypes, and did not offer a logical endpoint for when race-based admissions would cease. As a result, the programs violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, the Court noted that nothing prohibits universities from considering an applicant\u2019s discussion of how race affected the applicant\u2019s life, so long as that discussion is concretely tied to a quality of character or unique ability that the particular applicant can contribute to the university.</p>\n<p>Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh each wrote a concurring opinion.</p>\n<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson joined (except Justice Jackson took no part in the consideration or decision of the case against Harvard).</p>\n<p>Justice Jackson wrote a separate dissenting opinion.</p>\n"
