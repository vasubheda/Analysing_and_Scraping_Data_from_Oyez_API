    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Jae Lee came to the United States from South Korea with his family in 1982 and has lived in the United States legally ever since, though he did not become a citizen. He eventually moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he got involved in the drug trade. In 2009, after a successful sting operation, Lee was arrested and charged with possession of ecstasy with intent to distribute. The government\u2019s case against Lee was very strong, and on the advice of his attorney, Lee pled guilty in exchange for a lighter sentence. Lee\u2019s attorney had assured him that the guilty plea would not have immigration consequences; however, Lee\u2019s guilty plea constituted a conviction of an aggravated felony, which is a deportable offense under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Lee subsequently appealed his conviction and argued that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel under the standard established in Strickland v. Washington, which provides for a two-pronged test: whether the attorney\u2019s counsel was deficient and whether the deficiency prejudiced the defendant. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld Lee\u2019s conviction and determined that Lee could not satisfy the second prong of the Strickland test because there was not sufficient evidence that the outcome of Lee\u2019s case would have been substantially different had he known about the risk of deportation.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Under<em> Strickland v. Washington</em>, when a defendant claims that his plea was caused by ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant can demonstrate that he was prejudiced by showing a reasonable probability that, but for his counsel\u2019s errors, he would have gone to trial rather than accepting a plea. Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. delivered the opinion for the 6-2 majority. The Court held that the relevant question was not whether the defendant would have been acquitted at trial but whether, had the defendant been properly advised, he would have chosen to exercise his right to a trial. Even if a defendant were highly likely to lose at trial, as was the case here, inadequate assistance of counsel may still prejudice his ability to weigh his options and their potential consequences in deciding whether to take a plea. Because this inquiry was necessarily a fact-specific one that must be conducted on a case-by-case basis, the Court declined to create a sweeping, per se rule. In this case, Lee successfully demonstrated that avoiding deportation was a determinative issue in his decision-making, and therefore he met the standard to demonstrate that he suffered prejudice under the Strickland v. Washington standard for ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissent in which he argued that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of adequate assistance of counsel did not require counsel to provide accurate advice about the consequences of taking a plea. However, even under Sixth Amendment analysis, the majority opinion erred by applying a standard that did not require the defendant to show that the ineffective assistance of counsel he received prejudiced the outcome of the proceeding. Precedent established that the prejudice inquiry was not limited to the stage of the proceeding at which the defendant received the ineffective assistance; instead, there must be a reasonable probability that the outcome of the whole proceeding would have been different. In this case, there is not sufficient evidence to show a reasonable probability that the result of the criminal proceeding would have been different. Therefore the defendant failed to show prejudice under the <em>Strickland v. Washington</em> standard. Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. joined in the dissent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Justice Neil Gorsuch did not participate in the discussion or decision of this case. </p>\n"
