    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Taco Cabana, a fast food Mexican restaurant chain in San Antonio, Texas, had a specifically-designed look or \u201ctrade dress\u201d.  Two Pesos, another similar restaurant chain based in Houston, Texas, opened a few years later with a remarkably similar look.  Taco Cabana sued Two Pesos for trademark infringement under the Lanham Act.  Two Pesos allegedly copied Taco Cabana\u2019s distinctive trade dress.  The judge instructed the jury that trade dress must be inherently distinctive of have acquired a secondary meaning.  The jury found that Taco Cabana\u2019s trade dress was inherently distinctive, but had not acquired a secondary meaning.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  The court rejected Two Pesos argument that a finding of no secondary meaning necessarily means the trade dress is not inherently distinctive and is not protected under the Lanham Act.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>No.  Justice Byron R. White, writing for a unanimous court, affirmed the lower court's decision.  The Supreme Court held that trade dress can be protected under the Lanham Act based on inherent distinctiveness even if there is no proof of a secondary meaning.  Recovery is usually available for trademark infringement without a secondary meaning, and there is no persuasive reason for treating trade dress differently from other types of trademark.  Requiring a secondary meaning would go against the purposes of the Lanham Act.</p>\n<p>Justice Antonin Scalia concurred, stating that the Lanham Act and its common law counterpart were broad enough to cover trade dress.  Justice John Paul Stevens concurred in the judgment, expressing that the majority\u2019s decision was supported by stare decisis.  Justice Clarence Thomas also concurred in the judgment, arguing that the common law roots of the Lanham Act justify this decision better than the majority\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n"
