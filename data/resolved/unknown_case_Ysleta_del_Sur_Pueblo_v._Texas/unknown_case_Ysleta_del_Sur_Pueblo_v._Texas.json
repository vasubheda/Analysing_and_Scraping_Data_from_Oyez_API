    "description": "A case in which the Court will decide held that the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama-Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas Restoration Act provides the Pueblo with sovereign authority to regulate non-prohibited gaming activities (including bingo) on its lands.",
    "justia_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/596/20-493/",
    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Ysleta del Sur Pueblo is a federally recognized tribe with a reservation near El Paso, Texas. Under the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama and Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas Restoration Act, passed by Congress in 1987, the Pueblo agreed that its gaming activities would comply with Texas law. Another law, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, also regulates tribal gaming operations. The Pueblo engaged in gaming activity that violated state law but not the IGRA, and Texas filed a lawsuit to enjoin the tribe\u2019s gaming operations. The district court ruled in favor of the State of Texas, finding that the more restrictive Restoration Act controlled and prohibited the gaming operations. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>The Ysleta del Sur and Alabama and Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas Restoration Act applies to the case at hand and bans on tribal lands only those gaming activities also banned in Texas. Justice Neil Gorsuch authored the majority opinion of the Court</p>\n<p>Section 107 of the Restoration Act directly addresses gaming on the lands of the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, providing that \u201cgaming activities which are prohibited by [Texas law] are hereby prohibited on the reservation and on lands of the tribe.\u201d Activities that Texas law merely regulates and does not prohibit are outside the scope of the Act.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice John Roberts authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh joined.</p>\n"
