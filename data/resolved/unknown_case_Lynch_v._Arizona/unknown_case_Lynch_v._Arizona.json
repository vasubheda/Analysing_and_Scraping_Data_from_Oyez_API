    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Shawn Patrick Lynch was convicted of first-degree murder, kidnapping, armed robbery and burglary, with all the charges stemming from the 2001 kidnapping and murder of James Panzarella. Arizona sought the death penalty and moved to prevent Lynch\u2019s counsel from informing the jury that the only alternative to sentence to death was life without parole. The trial court granted the motion, and after the first jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict, the second jury sentenced Lynch to death. Lynch appealed and argued that, by granting Arizona\u2019s motion, the trial court had violated Lynch\u2019s Due Process Clause rights under the Supreme Court\u2019s precedent in <em>Simmons v. South Carolina</em>. In that case, the Supreme Court established that, when a capital defendant\u2019s future dangerousness is at issue and the only alternative to the death penalty is life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, the Due Process Clause grants the defendant the right to inform the jury of his ineligibility for parole. The Supreme Court of Arizona vacated the sentence without addressing the Simmons argument, and on remand the jury again sentenced Lynch to death. Lynch again appealed and raised the <em>Simmons</em> argument, which the Supreme Court of Arizona rejected by holding that the failure to inform the jury of Lynch\u2019s parole ineligibility was not error.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>The failure to notify the jury of the capital defendant\u2019s ineligibility for parole violates the defendant\u2019s rights to due process. In a per curiam opinion, the Court held that the precedent established in <em>Simmons v. South Carolina</em> clearly applied in this case. Because the capital defendant in this case would be ineligible for parole, despite the remote possibility of future developments such as a grant of executive clemency, he was entitled to inform the jury of his parole ineligibility, which the jury could then have factored into its decision regarding whether to sentence him to death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p>Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissent in which he argued that the Due Process Clause does not require the micromanagement of the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury regarding the sentencing possibilities in a capital case. As long as the jury instruction is a correct recitation of the law that should be sufficient to adequately inform the jury of whether the capital defendant would be eligible for parole if he was not sentenced to death. Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. joined in the dissent.</p>\n"
