    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Littleton required adult businesses to apply for a permit to operate from the city. If the city denied the license, the business could appeal to a state district court under the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure. Z.J. Gifts, an adult bookstore, wanted to operate in a place not zoned for adult businesses. Rather than apply for a license, they challenged the licensing law itself as unconstitutional, claiming that the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure provide merely for prompt judicial review of city denial, not for a prompt judicial decision. Because stores denied a license cannot operate until the court has made its decision, they could potentially be forced to wait indefinitely for a license based solely on the content of the material they intend to sell. This, Z.J. argued, violated the Supreme Court's holding in <em>Freedman v. Maryland</em>, 380 U.S. 51, that censorship laws must provide for \"prompt judicial determination.\"</p>\n<p>The federal district court sided with Littleton. A Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals panel reversed.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>No. In an opinion by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the Court held that Colorado did not have to explicitly provide for a \"prompt judicial determination\" to make the law constitutional. As long as Colorado courts did not unnecessarily delay such claims, the normal judicial review process could be expected to provide a decision quickly enough to satisfy the constitutional demands. If the courts failed to make a prompt decision in a specific case, the business in that particular case could sue, but the absence of explicit \"prompt judicial determination\" language in the statute did not make it unconstitutional.</p>\n"
