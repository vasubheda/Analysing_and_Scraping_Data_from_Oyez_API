    "description": "A case in which the Court held that, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, an inventor\u2019s sale of an invention to a third party invalidates the patent, even if the third party is obligated to keep the invention confidential.",

    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Helsinn owns four patents describing intravenous formulations\u00a0of palonosetron for reducing the likelihood of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (\u201cCINV\u201d). All four claim priority to a provisional patent application filed on January 30, 2003. The critical date for the on-sale bar is one year earlier, January 30, 2002, which means the sale of the invention before that date can invalidate the patent. In its defense, Teva argued that the asserted claims were invalid under the on-sale bar provision of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102.</p>\n<p>The sale referenced by Teva in its defense was an exclusive supply and purchase agreement between Helsinn and MGI Pharma. Everything about the agreement except the terms and price was publicly disclosed.</p>\n<p>The district court upheld as valid Helsinn\u2019s patents and rejected Teva\u2019s \u201con sale\u201d defense. The Federal Circuit reversed, finding that the patents were subject to an invalidating contract for sale prior to the critical date of January 30, 2002, The court also noted that the evidence that the formulation was ready for patenting before the critical date was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>An inventor\u2019s sale to a third party who is obligated to keep the invention confidential constitutes invalidating prior art. Justice Clarence Thomas authored the opinion for a unanimous (9\u20130) Court.</p>\n<p>The patent statute in force immediately before the America Invents Act (AIA) contained an \u201con-sale bar\u201d which invalidated patents that had been on sale. Applying the presumption that when Congress reenacts the same language, it adopts the earlier judicial construction of the phrase, the Court found that the AIA consequently prohibits patents that had previously been on sale. Therefore, the commercial sale to a third party who is required to keep the invention confidential falls within the on-sale bar of the AIA and invalidates the patent.</p>\n"
