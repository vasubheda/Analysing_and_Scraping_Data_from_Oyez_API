    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>These cases involve malpractice suits against Public Health Service (\"PHS\") employees. The plaintiffs filed actions recognized by <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics</em> in a California federal district court alleging violations of the Fifth and Eighth Amendments. The PHS sought a dismissal arguing that the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) preempted <em>Bivens</em> claims. The district court rejected the argument and denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that FTCA did not preempt <em>Bivens</em> claims. The court reasoned that the FTCA was enacted six months prior to the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Bivens</em> and, thus, could not have been intended as a substitute.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Yes. The Supreme Court held that the immunity provided by the FTCA precludes <em>Bivens</em> actions against individual PHS officers or employees for harms arising out of constitutional violations committed while acting within the scope of their offices or employment. Justice Sonia Sotamayor, writing for a unanimous Court, reasoned that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 233(a) plainly and clearly provides that the FTCA is the \"exclusive\" avenue for claims like those at issue in this case.</p>\n"
