    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Police entered Gregory Welch\u2019s apartment because they had reason to believe that a robbery suspect was on the premises. After obtaining Welch\u2019s consent to search the apartment, the police located a gun and ammunition that Welch later identified as his own. Welch was subsequently arrested and charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm, and he pleaded guilty. Because Welch had three prior felony convictions, the district court determined that the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) required that he be sentenced to a minimum of 15 years in prison. Welch appealed his sentence and argued that one of his felonies, a conviction for \u201cstrong arm\u201d robbery in Florida state court in 1996, did not qualify as a predicate offense for the purpose of the ACCA because, at the time he was convicted, Florida state law allowed for a conviction of robbery with a much lower level of force than the federal law required. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s determination that Welch\u2019s conviction for robbery under Florida state law was a predicate offense for the purpose of the ACCA because it involved force that was \u201ccapable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d</p>\n<p>In 2013, Welch filed a collateral challenge to his conviction and argued that his prior conviction for strong arm robbery vague and that his trial counsel had been ineffective in allowing him to be sentenced under the ACCA. He sought a certificate of appealability to the appellate court, which the district court denied. Welch then sought a certificate of appealability from the appellate court and noted that there was a challenge to the ACCA based on its vagueness pending in the Supreme Court, <em>Johnson v. United States</em>. The appellate denied the certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p>Three weeks later, the Supreme Court decided <em>Johnson v. United States</em> and held that the residual clause of the ACCA, which included action that \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d in the definition of a violent felony, was unconstitutionally vague. The Court held that the residual clause violated the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendments because it was so vague that it failed to give people adequate notice of the conduct it punished. In order to apply the residual clause to a case, courts had to assess the \u201chypothetical risk posed by an abstract generic version\u201d of the crime in question, which made the application of the clause unconstitutionally arbitrary and unpredictable.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>The rule that the Supreme Court announced in <em>Johnson v. United States</em> regarding what constitutes a violent offense for the purposes of sentencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act applies retroactively. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy delivered the opinion for the 7-1 majority. The Court held that the rule announced in Johnson, that the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) was unconstitutionally vague, was a substantive rule of criminal procedure because it altered \u201cthe range of conduct or class of persons that the law punishes.\u201d Unlike procedural rules that alter the permissible methods for determining whether conduct is punishable, substantive rules affect the reach of the statute itself rather than how it is applied. While procedural rules are generally not retroactive, substantive rules are; therefore, the rule the Court announced in Johnson should apply retroactively to this case.</p>\n<p>Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissent in which he argued that neither the Supreme Court nor the lower appellate court should have reviewed this case because Welch had failed to raise the <em>Johnson</em> vagueness claims at the district court level, and the higher courts should be reviewing only the decision that the district court made based on the issues presented there. Justice Thomas also wrote that the <em>Johnson</em> rule was not substantive because it did not place any class of persons or punishments outside of the statute\u2019s reach, nor did it announce a new constitutional rule. Instead, the rule in <em>Johnson</em> should be properly understood as addressing the manner of Congress\u2019 defining a sentencing enhancement, not the substantive conduct that triggers it. Therefore, the <em>Johnson</em> rule should not be given retroactive effect.</p>\n"
