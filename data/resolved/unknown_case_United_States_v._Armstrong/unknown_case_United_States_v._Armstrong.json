    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Christopher Lee Armstrong and others were indicted on federal charges of \"conspiring to possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base (crack) and conspiring to distribute the same.\" The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms had monitored Armstrong and others prior to their indictment and arrest. Armstrong filed a motion for discovery or dismissal, alleging that he was selected for prosecution because he was black. The District Court granted the discovery order. It ordered the government to provide statistics on similar cases from the last three years. The government indicated it would not comply. Subsequently, the District Court dismissed the case. The government appealed. The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal. It held that the proof requirements for a selective-prosecution claim do not require a defendant to demonstrate that the government has failed to prosecute others who are similarly situated.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Yes. In an 8-1 decision, announced by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court held that in order to file selective-prosecution claims, defendants must show that the government failed to prosecute similarly situated suspects of other races. \"If the claim . . . were well founded,\" wrote Rehnquist, \"it should not have been an insuperable task to prove that persons of a different race were not prosecuted.\"</p>\n"
