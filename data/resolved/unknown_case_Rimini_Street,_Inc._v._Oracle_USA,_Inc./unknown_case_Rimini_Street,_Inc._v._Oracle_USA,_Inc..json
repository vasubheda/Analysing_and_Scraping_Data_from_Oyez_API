    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Oracle licenses its enterprise software for a substantial one-time payment and also sells maintenance contracts to licensees so they can update their software through Oracle\u2019s support website. Rimini Street provided third-party support for Oracle\u2019s software in lawful competition with Oracle\u2019s direct maintenance service. To compete effectively, however, Rimini also needed to provide software updates to its customers, which would constitute copyright infringement if obtained without a proper license (which Rimini did not have). With Oracle\u2019s knowledge, Rimini obtained Oracle software updates from Oracle\u2019s website by a means that violated the Oracle website\u2019s terms of use.</p>\n<p>Oracle filed a lawsuit against Rimini and obtained a partial summary judgment and a jury verdict. The jury awarded Oracle $50,027,000 plus attorney\u2019s fees and costs, resulting in a total monetary judgment of $124,291,396.82. Rimini appealed the judgment. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, finding that 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505 allows for recovery of \u201cfull costs\u201d and the district court properly relied on Ninth Circuit precedent in <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/16-55577/16-55577-2017-11-16.html\"><em>Twentieth Century Fox v. Entertainment Distribution</em></a> in awarding $12,774,550.26 in non-taxable costs, despite ostensibly conflicting language in 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1920 identifying six categories of costs taxable against the losing party.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>The term \u201cfull costs\u201d in \u00a7 505 of the Copyright Act means only the costs specified in the general costs statute in \u00a7\u00a7 1821 and 1920. In a unanimous opinion by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Court held that the Ninth Circuit erred in awarding non-taxable costs to the prevailing party in the copyright infringement suit. Sections 1821 and 1920 define what the term \u201ccosts\u201d encompasses, and only Congress\u2014not the courts\u2014may award litigation expenses beyond those specified in those sections. The word \u201cfull\u201d in the statutory phrase \u201cfull costs\u201d refers only to all costs otherwise available under the law, not additional costs.</p>\n"
