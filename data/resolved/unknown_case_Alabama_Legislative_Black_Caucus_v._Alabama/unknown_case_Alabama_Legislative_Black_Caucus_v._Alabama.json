    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 focuses on preserving the equal representation of voters in different legislative voting districts. In 2012, the Alabama legislature redrew Alabama\u2019s electoral districts with the goal of creating districts with a population deviation of only 1%, as opposed to the 5% courts traditionally allow when evaluating redistricting efforts. Alabama also tried to maintain the existing percentage of minority voters in each electoral district. Petitioners sued in district court and argued that Alabama\u2019s redistricting violated the Voting Rights Act and amounted to racial gerrymandering that had negative impacts on the equal representation of racial minorities in multiple electoral districts. The district court held that the petitioners had failed to prove that Alabama used race as a \u201cdominant and controlling\u201d factor in redrawing its electoral districts and also that Alabama\u2019s goal of maintaining the minority population percentages in existing districts was \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to a compelling state interest. The Supreme Court noted probable jurisdiction to address the district court\u2019s application of existing legal principles.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>No. Justice Breyer delivered the opinion for the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the district court improperly considered evidence of statewide racial effects as a claim that the state used race as a factor when redrawing all of the boundary lines, when the actual allegations were that the racial gerrymandering took place in a few select electoral districts. Next, the Court held that the evidence suggested that the Caucus had standing to sue because it appeared to have members in every electoral district in the State of Alabama; the Court directed the Caucus to provide membership information sufficient to support this inference on remand. The district court also erred by considering Alabama\u2019s goal of obtaining a 1% population deviation among districts as a relevant factor to determine whether race was a \u201cpredominate\u201d factor in redrawing the electoral districts rather than considering the traditional goals of the Voting Rights Act. Finally, the Court rejected the district court\u2019s holding that Alabama\u2019s gerrymandering satisfied strict scrutiny. In application, Alabama\u2019s interest in maintaining a particular population percentage of minority voters in each district did not equate to the Voting Rights Act\u2019s goal of preventing \u201cretrogression in respect to racial minorities\u2019 \u2018ability . . . to elect their preferred candidates of choice\u2019; therefore, using a race as a factor to meet Alabama\u2019s extraneous goals was not justified. The Court vacated and remanded the district court\u2019s decision for further consideration consistent with its holding and additional evidence.</p>\n<p>Justice Antonin M. Scalia authored a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the majority decision reached beyond the record because the Caucus\u2019 complaint failed to adequately address the issues of standing and whether the allegations were a statewide claim or a select electoral district claim. Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. joined in the dissent. Justice Thomas also wrote a separate dissenting opinion in which he argued that the Court\u2019s quest to obtain \u201cthe best racial quota\u201d was an ill-begotten one, and that Alabama\u2019s task of complying with the convoluted goals of the Voting Rights Act was nearly impossible given all of the competing laws, jurisprudence, policies, and procedures.</p>\n"
