    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>After purchasing cocaine, Juan Melendez was charged with violating federal drug laws. The law carried a minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment. Melendez signed a plea agreement stating he would be cooperative. In turn the government agreed to give him a short sentence. The District Court thus sentenced Melendez to ten years in prison, the mandatory minimum. The Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>No. In a 7-2 decision authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court held that, in the absence of a Government motion requesting or authorizing the district court to \"impose a sentence below a level established by statute as minimum sentence,\" a prison sentence must not violate the statutory sentencing minimum.</p>\n"
