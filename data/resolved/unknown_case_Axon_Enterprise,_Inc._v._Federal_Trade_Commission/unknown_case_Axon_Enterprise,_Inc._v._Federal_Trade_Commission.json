    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Axon Enterprises manufactures personal body cameras for law enforcement. In 2018, it acquired a competitor body camera company called Vievu. After the acquisition, the Federal Trade Commission informed Axon that the transaction raised antitrust concerns and that the Commission would be investigating.</p>\n<p>At the end of 2019, the FTC informed Axon of its demands, which it could either accede or face administrative proceedings. Axon filed a lawsuit in federal district court alleging that (1) the FTC\u2019s administrative proceeding violates Axon\u2019s Fifth Amendment due process rights, (2) the FTC\u2019s structure violates Article II by providing improper insulation from the President, and (3) Axon\u2019s acquisition of Vievu did not violate antitrust law.</p>\n<p>The district court dismissed Axon\u2019s complaint, holding that the FTC\u2019s statutory scheme required Axon to raise its constitutional challenge first in the administrative proceeding. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, finding that Congress impliedly barred jurisdiction in federal district court.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Federal courts have federal-question jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges to the structure or existence of the SEC or FTC notwithstanding statutory review schemes set out in the Securities Exchange Act and Federal Trade Commission Act. Justice Elena Kagan authored the majority opinion holding that the Federal Trade Commission Act (in 21-86) and the Securities Exchange Act (in 21-1239) did not preclude district courts\u2019 ordinary subject-matter jurisdiction to hear challenges to those agencies\u2019 structure, procedure, or existence.</p>\n<p>The Court considered three factors, known as the Thunder Basin factors, to determine whether particular claims concerning agency</p>\n<p>action are \u201cof the type Congress intended to be reviewed within th[e] statutory structure,\u201d and thus would preclude district court jurisdiction. The three factors are: (1) Could precluding district court jurisdiction \u201cforeclose all meaningful judicial review\u201d of the claim? (2) Is the claim \u201cwholly collateral\u201d to the statute\u2019s review provisions? (3) Is the claim \u201coutside the agency\u2019s expertise\u201d?</p>\n<p>The Court concluded that all three factors supported the conclusion that district courts retained subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>First, preclusion of district court jurisdiction \u201ccould foreclose all meaningful judicial review\u201d because Axon and Cochran will lose their rights not to undergo the complained-of agency proceedings if they cannot assert those rights until the proceedings are over.</p>\n<p>Second, the claims are \u201cwholly collateral\u201d to the statutes\u2019 review provisions because challenges to the Commissions\u2019 authority have nothing to do with either the enforcement-related matters the Commissions regularly adjudicate or those they would adjudicate in assessing the charges against Axon and Cochran.</p>\n<p>Finally, the claims are outside the agencies\u2019 expertise because neither specializes in constitutional issues like separation of powers.</p>\n<p>Justice Clarence Thomas authored a concurring opinion to express \u201cgrave doubts about the constitutional propriety of Congress vesting administrative agencies with primary authority to adjudicate core private rights with only deferential judicial review on the back end.\u201d</p>\n<p>Justice Neil Gorsuch authored an opinion concurring in the judgment, arguing that he would reach the same conclusion as the majority by applying only 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, which establishes federal-question jurisdiction of federal courts.</p>\n"
