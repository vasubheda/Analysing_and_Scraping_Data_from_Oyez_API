Mitchell\u2019s simultaneous service on the US Court of Military Commission Review (CMCR) and the US Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals (AFCCA) violated the Appointments Clause; (3) whether Judge Mitchell\u2019s service on the CMCR disqualified him from continuing to serve on the AFCCA; and (4) whether the US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces erred in holding Petitioner\u2019s claims moot.",
