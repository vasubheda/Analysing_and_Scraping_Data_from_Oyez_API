    "description": "A case in which the Court held that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act\u2019s expropriation exception, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71605(a)(3), incorporates the domestic takings rule, which recognizes that a foreign sovereign\u2019s taking of its own nationals\u2019 property is not a violation of international law.",

    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In 1929, just weeks before the October 1929 global stock market crash, several Jewish art dealers in Germany purchased a collection of medieval reliquaries. During the ensuing global depression, the dealers sold about half the pieces and stored the remainder in the Netherlands. Nazi leaders negotiated with the dealers to buy the remaining pieces; the parties dispute whether this negotiation was made under coercive circumstances. After World War II, the collection was transferred to Stiftung Preussischer Kulturbesitz (\u201cSPK\u201d), a German governmental institution that holds the cultural artifacts of former Prussia, and has been on display in a German museum nearly continuously since then.</p>\n<p>In 2014, heirs of the Jewish art dealers\u2014respondents in this case\u2014participated in a non-binding mediation process before the Advisory Commission for the Return of Cultural Property Seized as a Result of Nazi Persecution, Especially Jewish Property (the \u201cAdvisory Commission\u201d). In what the heirs describe as a \u201cpredetermined conclusion, and against the evidence,\u201d the Advisory Commission recommended against restitution of the collection.</p>\n<p>The respondents filed a lawsuit in federal court in the District of Columbia, invoking the expropriation exception of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which abrogates foreign sovereign immunity when \u201crights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue,\u201d as the jurisdictional basis for their claims. Germany and SPK moved to dismiss, and the district court largely denied the motion, holding the claims fell within the scope of the expropriation exception. Germany and SPK appealed, and the U.S. Appeals Court for D.C. affirmed as to jurisdiction, reiterating its holding in a prior case that a genocidal taking is a violation of international law and rejecting Germany\u2019s and SPK\u2019s argument based on principles of international comity.\u00a0</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>The expropriation exception of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a71605(a)(3), incorporates the domestic takings rule, which recognizes that a foreign sovereign\u2019s taking of its own nationals\u2019 property is not a violation of international law. Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the majority opinion for a unanimous Court.</p>\n<p>FSIA immunizes foreign sovereigns from the jurisdiction of United States courts, subject to several specific exceptions, including the so-called expropriation exception, which abrogates immunity in any case \u201cin which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a71605(a)(3). The taking of property by a foreign sovereign from its own nationals, at issue in this case, does not violate international law because it does not interfere with relations among states. Known as the domestic takings rule, this principle has endured, notwithstanding developments in other areas of international human rights law. The text of FSIA\u2019s expropriation exception supports this interpretation, as do other provisions of FSIA. Because Germany took property from its own citizens, that act did not violate international law and thus cannot be the basis for an exemption to sovereign immunity under the FSIA\u2019s expropriation exemption.</p>\n"
