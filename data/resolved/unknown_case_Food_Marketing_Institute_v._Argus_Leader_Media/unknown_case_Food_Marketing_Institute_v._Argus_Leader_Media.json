    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>The Food Stamp Act of 1964 started one of the largest and fastest-growing welfare programs in the country. Formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) spent over $78 billion on over 46 million people in fiscal year 2012, as compared to the $75 million spent during its first year. Respondent Argus Leader Media, who runs a newspaper in South Dakota, invoked the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to seek information from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) on how much money individual retailers received from taxpayers each year. The USDA refused to provide the information, citing numerous exemptions to FOIA.</p>\n<p>Argus filed a lawsuit against the USDA in federal district court, which found that the USDA properly withheld the information under FOIA Exemption 3, which applies to information prohibited from disclosure by another federal law. On appeal, the Eighth Circuit reversed, finding that Exemption 3 did not apply to the contested data, and remanded the case back to the district court. On remand, the issue before the court was whether Exemption 4\u2014which covers \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential\u201d\u2014applied to the information sought.</p>\n<p>For the purpose of applying Exemption 4, the circuit courts have adopted a definition of \u201cconfidential\u201d different from the term\u2019s ordinary meaning. Courts have held the term to mean that Exemption 4 applies only if disclosure is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the source of the information. There is a circuit split as to what \u201csubstantial competitive harm\u201d means. The district court in this case adopted the definition from the DC Circuit, which has held that \u201ccompetitive harm may be established if there is evidence of \u2018actual competition and the likelihood of substantial competitive injury.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 Appling that definition to the facts at hand, the court found speculative the USDA\u2019s claims of competitive injury and entered judgment for Argus. The USDA decided not to appeal the judgment, so petitioner Food Marketing Institute (FMI) intervened and filed the appeal. On appeal, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the district court.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Where commercial or financial information is both customarily and actually treated as private by its owner and provided to the government under an assurance of privacy, the information is \u201cconfidential\u201d within the meaning of Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(4). Justice Neil Gorsuch delivered the 6-3 majority opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Court first looked to whether the Food Marketing Institute had standing to appeal. The Institute would suffer financial injury as a result of disclosure, such injury would be the direct consequence of a judgment ordering disclosure, and a favorable ruling by the Supreme Court in this case would redress that injury. As such, the Court concluded the Institute has standing.</p>\n<p>At the time FOIA was enacted, the term \u201cconfidential\u201d meant \u201cprivate\u201d or \u201csecret.\u201d For information that is communicated from one party to another, that means that (1) the information is customarily kept private, and (2) the party receiving it has provided some assurance that it will remain private. In this case, it is uncontested that retailers customarily keep private the type of information at issue. Thus, under the plain meaning of the term, the information is \u201cconfidential.\u201d</p>\n<p>In giving the word \u201cconfidential\u201d a different meaning in <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/498/765/325665/\"><em>National Parks &amp; Conservation Assn. v. Morton</em>, 498 F.2d 765 (D.C. Cir. 1974)</a>, the DC Circuit inappropriately relied on legislative history rather than first going to the statute\u2019s text and structure. The concept of \u201csubstantial competitive harm\u201d that the DC Circuit developed is based not on statutory language but on testimony of witnesses in congressional hearings on a different bill that was never enacted. Additionally, while true that courts should \u201cnarrowly construe\u201d FOIA exemptions, courts cannot arbitrarily constrict Exemption 4 by adding limitations found nowhere in its text.</p>\n<p>Justice Stephen Breyer filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor joined. Justice Breyer articulated a third condition for finding confidentiality in addition to the two described by the majority: \u201crelease of such information must cause genuine harm to the owner\u2019s economic or business interests.\u201d While Justice Breyer agreed with the majority that the \u201csubstantial competitive harm\u201d rule from the DC Circuit is unworkable, he argued that the majority incorrectly interpreted Exemption 4 as having no harm requirement whatsoever. According to Justice Breyer, \u201cthe language permits, and the purpose, precedent, and context all suggest, an interpretation that insists upon some showing of harm.\u201d</p>\n"
