    "description": "A case in which the Court decided that the tolling provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 suspends or \u201cstops the clock\u201d on the limitations period for supplemental state law claims while the underlying case is pending in federal court and for 30 days thereafter, rather than merely providing a 30-day grace period after dismissal for the plaintiff to refile in state court.",

    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In 2007, Stephanie Artis was employed by the District of Columbia Department of Health (DOH) as a code inspector. She alleges that she and her supervisor developed a contentious relationship and that he singled her out for unfair treatment in the workplace. On April 17, 2009, Artis took her first administrative step against DOH by filing a discrimination claim with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and while that claim was pending, DOH terminated Artis\u2019s employment in November 2010.</p>\n<p>In December 2011, Artis filed a lawsuit against the District in federal court alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and invoked the district court\u2019s supplemental jurisdiction to assert claims based on the District\u2019s Whistleblower Act, False Claims Act, and common law. The district court granted the District\u2019s motion on the pleadings and dismissed Artis\u2019s sole federal claim, violation of Title VII, as facially deficient. It thus found it had no basis to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining claims.</p>\n<p>Fifty-nine days after her claims were dismissed in federal court, Artis filed the remaining claims in a D.C. trial court. The District alleged that Artis\u2019s claims were time barred based on the respective statutes of limitations, and the trial judge agreed, finding that the federal supplemental jurisdiction statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(d) does not suspend state statutes of limitations at the time of the unsuccessful federal filing.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>In a 5-4 decision, the Court reversed and remanded, ruling in favor of Artis and finding that the tolling provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 operates to suspend or \u201cstop-the-clock\u201d on supplemental state court claims while the concordant federal suit is pending and for 30 days thereafter. The majority rejected the District of Columbia\u2019s argument that the statute simply provides for a 30-day grace period to refile those claims in state court. The Court also rejected the argument that it should disavow the stop-the-clock approach as a matter of constitutional avoidance, explaining that questions regarding the constitutionality of \u00a71367(d) had been settled under prior case law. Justice Gorsuch dissented, with Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy joining.</p>\n"
