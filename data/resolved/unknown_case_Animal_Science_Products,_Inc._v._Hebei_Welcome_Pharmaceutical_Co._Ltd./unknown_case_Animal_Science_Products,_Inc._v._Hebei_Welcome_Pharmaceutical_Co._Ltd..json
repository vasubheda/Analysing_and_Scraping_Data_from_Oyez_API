    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Animal Science Products, Inc., et al. (\u201cPetitioners\u201d) are US vitamin C purchasers who commenced a multidistrict class action lawsuit against Hebei Welcome Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., et al. (\u201cRespondents\u201d), which are business entities incorporated under the laws of China, alleging violations of U.S. antitrust laws. Specifically, they claimed that Respondents engaged in price-fixing and supply manipulation in violation of the Sherman and Clayton Acts. Respondents did not deny that they had coordinated prices and sought to create a supply shortage, but moved to dismiss on the grounds that they acted in accordance with Chinese government regulations requiring them to do so. The district court denied Respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss and a subsequent motion for summary judgment. Following a jury trial, the court entered a judgment of approximately $147 million against Respondents, and enjoined them from engaging in any further anti-competitive activity.</p>\n<p>Respondents appealed to the 2nd Circuit, which vacated the judgment, reversed the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss, and remanded the case with instructions for the lower court to dismiss Petitioners\u2019 complaint with prejudice. The appellate court based its reversal on international comity grounds, explaining that the district court had erred in not deferring appropriately to the Chinese government\u2019s explanation of its domestic laws, which mandated the conduct by Respondents that was considered anti-competitive under US law. Particularly given that the Chinese government had appeared in the proceedings, the fact that Respondents could not simultaneously comply with US and Chinese laws necessitated the conclusion that the district court should have abstained from exercising jurisdiction in this case. The appeals court further held that other factors significant under an international comity balancing test derived from 3rd and 9th Circuit case law affirmed that abstention was appropriate in the instant matter.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>In a unanimous decision, Court reversed and remanded, holding that a federal court determining foreign law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1 should accord respectful consideration to a foreign government\u2019s submission, but the court is not bound to accord conclusive effect to the foreign government\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p>Writing for the Court, Justice Ginsburg explained that under Rule 44.1, a court\u2019s determination of foreign law \u201cmust be treated as ruling on a question of law.\u201d Further, in evaluating the foreign law question at issue, a court may consider any relevant material, and is not limited to materials submitted by the parties.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Court further stated that neither Rule 44.1 nor other sources speak to the weight that a court must give to a foreign government\u2019s submissions, and while in the spirit of international comity a court should \u201ccarefully consider\u201d a foreign state\u2019s views regarding the meaning of its own laws, the ultimate import of those views will vary based on a number of factors. While no specific formula will apply in all cases, key considerations include: the statement\u2019s \u201cclarity, thoroughness, and support\u201d; \u201cits context and purpose\u201d; \u201cthe transparency of the foreign legal system\u201d; \u201cthe role and authority of the entity or official offering the statement\u201d; and \u201cthe statement\u2019s consistency with the foreign government\u2019s past positions.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Court concluded that when viewed in the context of these considerations, the 2nd Circuit\u2019s ruling was inconsistent with both Rule 44.1 and the Court\u2019s treatment of analogous state government submissions. Further, in focusing on the Chinese government\u2019s statements, the appellate court overlooked evidence in the record submitted by the U.S. purchasers. The Court additionally stated that the ruling below was inconsistent with international practice. The case was sent back to the lower courts for further consideration consistent with the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n"
