    "description": "A case in which the Court held that a miscalculation of a Federal Guidelines sentencing range that has been determined to be plain and to affect a defendant\u2019s substantial rights calls for a court of appeals to exercise its discretion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) to vacate the defendant\u2019s sentence in the ordinary case.",

    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Florencio Rosales-Mireles pleaded guilty to illegal reentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). His total criminal-history score was calculated according to the US Sentencing Guidelines Manual, but when calculating the criminal-history score, the probation officer erroneously counted a 2009 Texas conviction of misdemeanor assault twice. His total criminal-history score, combined with other factors, led a sentence of 78 months of imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release. Rosales-Mireles did not object to the sentence after it was imposed.</p>\n<p>The Fifth Circuit found that Rosales-Mireles met the three prongs necessary to meet the plain error standard. However, if all three prongs are met, the court has the discretion to remedy the plain error if the error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d The court declined to exercise its discretion in this case and therefore affirmed the judgment of sentence.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>The Court reversed and remanded, holding that a miscalculation of a Federal Guidelines sentencing range that has been determined to be plain and to affect a defendant\u2019s substantial rights calls for a court of appeals to exercise its discretion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) to vacate the defendant\u2019s sentence in the ordinary case.</p>\n<p>In a 7-2 opinion authored by Justice Sotomayor, the Court explained that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s narrow shock-the conscience standard was too restrictive in defining the extent of the appellate court\u2019s jurisdiction in this context. The risk of unnecessary deprivation of liberty that can result from this narrow approach undermines the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings where a Guidelines error is plain, because it is ultimately the district court that is responsible for ensuring that it applies the correct Guidelines range. In addition, the Court stated that remands for resentencing are inexpensive compared to remands for retrial, and ensuring that Guidelines determinations are accurate furthers the Sentencing Commission\u2019s goals of uniformity and proportionality in sentencing.</p>\n<p>Justice Thomas authored a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justice Alito.</p>\n"
