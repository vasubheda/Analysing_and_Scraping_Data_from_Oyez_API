    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>This case arises out of a complex procedural history involving a patent dispute between several parties and concerns not the merits of the proceedings but a procedural aspect of it.</p>\n<p>The America Invents Act created \u201cinter partes review\u201d as a way of challenging a patent before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. One provision, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 315(b), precludes the institution of inter partes review more than one year after the petitioner \u201cis served with a complaint\u201d alleging infringement of the patent. The parties disagree over whether this one-year time bar applies when the underlying patent infringement suit has been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p>The Federal Circuit, sitting en banc, held that it does apply. The court rejected the argument that a voluntary dismissal without prejudice restores the parties to their positions as though no legal proceedings had ever begun, concluding instead that a defendant served with a complaint remains \u201cserved\u201d even if the civil action is voluntarily dismissed without prejudice and thus does such a dismissal does not toll the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p>Further, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 315(d) provides that \u201cthe determination by the Director whether to institute an inter partes review under this section shall be final and nonappealable.\u201d Notwithstanding this provision, the en banc Federal Circuit held that a decision to institute an inter partes review after finding that the \u00a7 315(b) time bar did not apply was appealable.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Section 314(d) precludes judicial review of a Patent Trial and Appeal Board\u2019s decision to institute inter partes review upon finding that \u00a7315(b)\u2019s time bar did not apply. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered the 7-2 majority opinion for the Court.</p>\n<p>The text of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 314(d), as well as the Court\u2019s decision in Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v. Lee, 579 U.S. __ (2016), preclude a party from arguing on appeal that the agency should have refused \u201cto institute an inter partes review.\u201d A challenge under \u00a7 315(d) constitutes an appeal of the agency\u2019s decision \u201cto institute an inter partes review\u201d and thus falls within the general prohibition of \u00a7 314(d). The majority (though without Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito) found further support for this understanding in the statute\u2019s purpose and design, which is \u201cto weed out bad patent claims efficiently.\u201d The Court found Click-to-Call\u2019s claims to the contrary unpersuasive.</p>\n<p>Justice Neil Gorsuch filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Sotomayor joined in large part, arguing that the majority\u2019s decision allows a \u201cpolitically guided agency\u201d to take the rightful property of an inventor and immunizes the agency\u2019s action from judicial review.</p>\n"
