    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>On April 27, 1988, Margaret McIntyre distributed leaflets to persons attending a public meeting in Ohio expressing her opposition to a proposed school tax levy. Though they were independently produced, she signed them as the views of \"Concerned Parents and Tax Payers.\" Mrs. McIntyre was subsequently fined $100 for violating Section 3599.09(A) of the Ohio Elections Commission Code prohibiting the distribution of campaign literature that does not contain the name and address of the person or campaign official issuing the literature.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Yes. The freedom to publish anonymously is protected by the First Amendment and \"extends beyond the literary realm to the advocacy of political causes.\" When a law burdens such anonymous speech, the Court applies \"exacting scrutiny,\" upholding the restriction only if it is narrowly tailored to serve an overriding state interest.</p>\n"
