    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Scott Tucker owned several companies that provided high-interest, short-term loans via several websites. The loans allegedly required customers to agree to terms that were obscured in several long, cross-referenced agreements. In April 2012, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) filed a lawsuit against Tucker and his businesses in federal court in Nevada. The Commission alleged that Tucker\u2019s loan business violated \u00a7 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (\u201cFTC Act\u201d)\u2019s prohibition against \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\u201d The Commission asked the court to enjoin Tucker from engaging in consumer lending and to order him to disgorge his profits from the scheme.</p>\n<p>The court granted the Commission\u2019s requested relief, enjoined Tucker from providing loans, and ordered him to pay approximately $1.27 billion in equitable monetary relief to the Commission. The court instructed the Commission to direct \u201cas much money as practicable\u201d to \u201cdirect redress to consumers,\u201d then to \u201cother equitable relief\u201d related to the practices described in the Commission\u2019s complaint, and finally to the U.S. Treasury as disgorgement. Tucker appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. In relevant part, the Ninth Circuit rejected Tucker\u2019s argument that the FTC Act authorizes district courts only to enter \u201cinjunctions,\u201d and that the district court\u2019s order to pay \u201cequitable monetary relief\u201d is not an injunction. The Ninth Circuit noted that its precedent squarely holds that \u00a7 13 of the FTC Act \u201cempowers district courts to grant any ancillary relief necessary to accomplish complete justice.\u201d</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Section 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act does not authorize the Commission to seek, or a court to award, equitable monetary relief such as restitution or disgorgement. Justice Stephen Breyer authored the unanimous opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Congress established the Federal Trade Commission in 1914 to enforce the Act\u2019s prohibitions on \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices\u201d by initiating administrative proceedings under Section 5 of the Act. Section 13(b) of the Act, which Congress added in 1973, authorizes the Commission to obtain \u201cin proper cases\u201d a permanent injunction in federal court against \u201cany person, partnership, or corporation\u201d that the Commission believes \u201cis violating, or is about to violate, any provision of law\u201d that the Commission enforces. In the late 1970s, the Commission began using Section 13(b) to obtain court orders in consumer protection cases without the prior use of the administrative proceedings in Section 5 of the Act, and in the 1990s, it extended that practice to seek monetary awards in antitrust cases. Today, the Commission frequently uses Section 13(b) to seek equitable monetary relief directly in court.</p>\n<p>The Court concluded that the Commission\u2019s practice effectively bypasses the process set forth in Section 5 and was not the intent of the Congress that enacted Section 13(b). The provision does not explicitly authorize the Commission to obtain court-ordered monetary relief, and such relief is foreclosed by the structure and history of the Act.</p>\n"
