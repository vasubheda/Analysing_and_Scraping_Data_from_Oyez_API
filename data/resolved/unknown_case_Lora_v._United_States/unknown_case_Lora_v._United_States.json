    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Efrain Lora and three co-defendants ran an operation selling cocaine and cocaine base in the Bronx. Lora and the others allegedly conspired to murder a rival drug dealer in retaliation for threats the rival had made over drug territory.</p>\n<p>A federal grand jury returned an indictment for aiding and abetting the use and carrying of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime causing the death of a person. The government obtained a superseding indictment against Lora that added a drug trafficking conspiracy charge and a charge for causing an intentional killing in furtherance of that conspiracy. The jury found Lora guilty of all three counts, and the district court sentenced him to a five-year term of imprisonment for the first count to run consecutively with a 25-year sentence on the second two counts. Lora appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the consecutive sentences.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>The bar on imposition of concurrent sentences in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7924(c)(1)(D)(ii) does not apply to a sentence for a \u00a7924(j) conviction; a \u00a7924(j) sentence can run either concurrently with or consecutively to another sentence. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson authored the unanimous opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584, a federal court imposing multiple prison sentences typically has the discretion to run the sentences concurrently or consecutively. However, \u00a7 924(c) provides that \u201cno term of imprisonment imposed on a person under this subsection shall run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment.\u201d Lora was convicted under \u00a7 924(j)(1), which penalizes \u201ca person who, in the course of a violation of subsection (c), causes the death of a person through the use of a firearm,\u201d where \u201cthe killing is a murder.\u201d A violation of subsection (c) occurs when a person \u201cuses or carries a firearm\u201d \u201cduring and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime,\u201d or \u201cpossesses a firearm\u201d \u201cin furtherance of any such crime.\u201d The limitation of subsection (c) applies only to that subsection and not to subsection (j), and Congress could not have intended subsection (j) to incorporate subsection (c)\u2019s penalties in addition to its own. Subsection (j) covers a more serious offense, so the resulting flexibility in sentencing is consistent with the statute\u2019s design.</p>\n<p>The Court thus vacated the judgment of the Second Circuit, which held that subsection (c)\u2019s prohibition on concurrent sentences applies to violations of subsection (j).</p>\n"
