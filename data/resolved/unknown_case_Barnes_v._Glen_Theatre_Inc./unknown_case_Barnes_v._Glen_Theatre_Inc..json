    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Glen Theatre and the Kitty Kat Lounge in South Bend, Indiana, operated entertainment establishments with totally nude dancers. An Indiana law regulating public nudity required dancers to wear \"pasties\" and a \"G-string\" when they perform. The Theatre and Lounge sued to stop enforcement of the statute.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>No. The Court was fractured and there was no majority opinion. Chief Justice Rehnquist, in a plurality opinion, conceded that nude dancing was a form of expressive activity. But he maintained that the public indecency statute is justified despite the incidental limitations on such expressive activity. The statute \"furthers a substantial government interest in protecting order and morality.\" The proscription on public nudity is unrelated to the erotic message the dancers seek to convey.</p>\n"
