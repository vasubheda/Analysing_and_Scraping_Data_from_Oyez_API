    "description": "A case in which the Court held that the Uniform Code of Military Justice\u2019s provision allowing rape, which is \u201cpunishable by death\u201d under the UCMJ, to be \u201ctried and punished at any time without limitation\u201d is not affected by the Court\u2019s precedent holding that the Eighth Amendment prohibits a death sentence for rape of an adult woman.",

    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In 2014, a general court-martial composed of a military judge alone found Michael Briggs guilty of rape in violation of Article 120(a), Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a) (2000), for conduct that occurred nine years earlier, in 2005. The UCMJ allows for a military offense that is punishable by death to be \u201ctried and punished at any time without limitation.\u201d In contrast, other military offenses are subject to a five-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p>Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584 (1977), which held that the Eighth Amendment prohibited a death sentence for rape of an adult woman, Briggs argued on appeal that rape was not \u201cpunishable by death\u201d and thus was subject to the five-year statute of limitations for non-capital crimes. The United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals (AFCCA) rejected his challenge because Briggs had not raised the statute of limitations claim at trial. The court therefore affirmed the finding and sentence of the judge below. Briggs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. Reviewing for plain error, the C.A.A.F. reversed the lower court, finding that the Rules for Courts-Martial R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(B) requires the military judge to inform the accused of the right to assert the statute of limitations. As such, the court found that if the military judge had informed Briggs of a possible statute of limitations defense, he would have sought dismissal.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces erred in concluding that the five-year statute of limitations applies to the prosecution of rape. Justice Samuel Alito authored the opinion on behalf of a unanimous (8-0) Court.</p>\n<p>The UCMJ exempts offenses \u201cpunishable by death\u201d from the statute of limitations for prosecutions. Even though the offense of rape is no longer punishable by death, the context of that phrase implies that the offense itself is still not subject to the statute of limitations that applies to other offenses. First, the UCMJ is a \u201cuniform\u201d code, which means that it generally refers only to other provisions within the UCMJ itself, rather than external sources of law. The \u201cmost natural place\u201d to determine whether rape was \u201cpunishable by death\u201d and thus exempt from the statute of limitations is the UCMJ itself. Second, statutes of limitations are intended to provide clarity, and having to consider \u201call applicable law\u201d to determine whether an offense is punishable by death obscures, rather than clarifies, the filing deadline. Finally, it is \u201cunlikely\u201d that lawmakers would want a statute of limitations to refer to judicial interpretations of such provisions, given that the purposes of statutes of limitations differ from the ends served courts\u2019 Eighth Amendment analysis.</p>\n<p>Justice Neil Gorsuch authored a concurring opinion to opine that the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear appeals directly from the CAAF but expressing agreement with the majority on the merits.</p>\n<p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</p>\n"
