    "description": "A case in which the Court held that the Armed Career Criminal Act\u2019s \u201cserious drug offense\u201d definition requires only that a state offense involve the conduct specified in the statute; it does not require that the state offense match certain generic offenses.",
    "justia_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/589/18-6662/",
    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) provides in relevant part that a person who has three previous convictions for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d or a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d shall serve a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison. In recent cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has adopted a \u201ccategorical\u201d approach to determine whether a prior conviction constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the ACCA. Under this approach, the sentencing court must look only to the statutory definition of the prior offense and not to the particular facts underlying the prior convictions. At issue in this case is whether the categorical approach applies to the determination of whether a prior conviction constitutes a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d as well.</p>\n<p>Eddie Lee Shular qualified as an armed career criminal on the basis of six prior Florida convictions for controlled substance offenses\u2014five for sale of cocaine and one for possession with intent to sell. None of these offenses required that the government prove that Shular had \u201cknowledge of the illicit nature of the substance,\u201d that is, that the substance possessed or sold was cocaine. Under the categorical approach, none of Shular\u2019s Florida convictions would qualify as a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d because the Florida crimes are broader than the generic drug analogues under federal law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit rejected the categorical approach to serious drug offenses, holding that the plain language of the ACCA definition \u201crequires only that the predicate offense involve certain activities related to controlled substances.\u201d</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>The statute does not require \u201ca generic-offense matching exercise\u201d between the elements of the offenses listed in the federal statute and the elements of the state offense under which the defendant was convicted. Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Ginsburg adopted the argument of the United States, which instead would have the trial court asked \u201cwhether the state offense\u2019s elements necessarily entail one of the types of conduct\u201d identified in the federal statute.</p>\n<p>The Court found that two features of the statute in question lead to this interpretation. The first is that the offenses listed in the statute are \u201cunlikely names for generic offenses\u201d and therefore refer to underlying conduct and not offenses themselves. Secondly, the use of the word \u201cinvolving\u201d in the statute suggests an intention to describe criminal conduct and not particular criminal offenses.</p>\n<p>The Court noted that both parties\u2019 interpretations of the statutory language \u201cachieve a measure of inconsistency. Justice Ginsburg explained, \u201cResolving this case requires us to determine which form of consistency Congress intended: application of [the statute] to all offenders who engaged in certain conduct or to all who committed certain generic offenses (in either reading, judging only by the elements of their prior convictions).\u201c She continued, \u201cFor the reasons explained, we are persuaded that Congress chose the former.\u201d</p>\n<p>In a brief concurring opinion, Justice Kavanaugh stated he joined the Court\u2019s opinion in full but wrote separately to explain that the rule of lenity advocated by Shular was not appropriately invoked where the Court found the statutory language unambiguous.\u00a0</p>\n"
