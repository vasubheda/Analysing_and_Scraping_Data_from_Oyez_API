    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Tarahrick Terry pleaded guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute a substance containing a \u201cdetectable\u201d amount of cocaine base (3.9 grams), thus triggering the penalties in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Based on his prior convictions, the statutory term of imprisonment was 0 to 30 years, and the district court sentenced him to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment with 6 years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p>Terry moved for a sentence reduction on the basis that the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 raised the weight ceiling of \u00a7 841(b) from 5 grams of cocaine base to 28 grams. The district court denied his motion, concluding that Terry did not commit a \u201ccovered offense\u201d and thus was not eligible for relief under the First Step Act, which made retroactive the statutory penalties for certain offenses committed before August 3, 2010. Because the Fair Sentencing Act did not expressly amend \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), Terry\u2019s offense was not a \u201ccovered offense.\u201d</p>\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Crack offenders sentenced under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) do not have a \u201ccovered offense\u201d under Section 404 of the First Step Act because a sentence reduction under the Act is available only if an offender\u2019s prior conviction of a crack cocaine offense triggered a mandatory minimum sentence. Justice Clarence Thomas authored the majority opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>An offender is eligible for a sentence reduction only if he previously received \u201ca sentence for a covered offense,\u201d which the Act defines as \u201ca violation of a Federal criminal statute, the statutory penalties for which were modified by\u201d certain provisions in the Fair Sentencing Act. The Fair Sentencing Act modified the statutory penalties only for offenses that triggered mandatory-minimum penalties. Because Terry was convicted for an offense that does not have a mandatory minimum, his offense was not a \u201ccovered offense\u201d and thus was not eligible for a sentence reduction under the Act.</p>\n<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor authored an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. She expressly declined to join the majority\u2019s \u201csanitized\u201d description of the history of penalties for crack offenses and pointed out that because Terry was both convicted under subparagraph (C) and sentenced as a career offender, he never had a chance to ask for a sentence that reflects today\u2019s understanding of the lesser severity of his crime, and he never will get that chance without action by the political branches.</p>\n"
