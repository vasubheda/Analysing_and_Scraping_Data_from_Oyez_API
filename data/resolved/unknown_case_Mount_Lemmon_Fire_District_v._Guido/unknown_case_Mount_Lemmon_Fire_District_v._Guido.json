    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In 2000, John Guido and Dennis Rankin were hired by the Mount Lemmon Fire District, a political subdivision of the State of Arizona. They were full-time firefighter captains, and at ages 46 and 54, respectively, were the two oldest full-time employees at the Fire District when they were terminated in 2009. Guido and Rankin filed age discrimination charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which found reasonable cause to believe that the Fire District had violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-34. Guido and Rankin subsequently filed suit against the Fire District.</p>\n<p>The Fire District sought summary judgment on the basis that it was not an \u201cemployer\u201d within the meaning of the ADEA, and the district court agreed. A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed. Ruling counter to what other circuits have concluded, the appellate court stated that a political subdivision of a state does not need to have 20 or more employees, as private sector employers do, in order to be covered by the ADEA.\u00a0</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>In a unanimous (8\u20130) opinion authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court held that the ADEA applies to all state political subdivisions, regardless of the number of employees.\u00a0 The Court first looked to the plain language of the statute, finding the two-sentence delineation in the definitional provision\u00a0\u00a7 630(b), coupled with the expression \u201calso means\u201d at the start of \u00a7630(b)\u2019s second\u00a0sentence, establish two separate categories: persons engaged\u00a0in an industry affecting commerce with 20 or more employees;\u00a0and states or political subdivisions. The latter category has no numerosity limitation. For this reason, the Court found that Mount Lemmon Fire District was subject to the ADEA despite the number of full-time employees there.</p>\n<p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n"
