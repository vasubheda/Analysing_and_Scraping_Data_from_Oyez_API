    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>The city of Chicago hired the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company (Great Lakes) to perform work that would prevent ships from bumping into piers. To that end, Great Lakes used a crane to drive piles into the riverbed, which potentially weakened the structure of the freight tunnel that ran below the river. On April 13, 1992, water from the Chicago River poured into a freight tunnel, which subsequently flooded into the basements of several buildings. After the flood, many victims sued Great Lakes in state court and argued that the flood was the result of the weakening of the tunnel. Great Lakes Dredge and Dock removed the case to federal district court and argued federal admiralty court had jurisdiction of marine cases. The district court dismissed the suit for lack of admiralty jurisdiction, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Yes. Justice David Souter delivered the opinion of the 7-0 majority. The Court held the federal district court has admiralty jurisdiction to determine and limit the extent of the Great Lakes\u2019 tort of liability. Admiralty jurisdiction is appropriate when a party can prove either that the tort occurred on navigable water or that the injury on land was caused by actions on navigable water. In this case, this condition is satisfied since the alleged tort was committed on navigable water, and it is not necessary to prove that the subsequent damage was close in time and space. Great Lakes proved the connection with maritime activity by showing how the damage caused by a vessel on navigable water to an underwater structure is potentially disruptive to maritime commerce.</p>\n"
