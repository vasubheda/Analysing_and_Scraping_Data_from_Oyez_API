    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In these consolidated cases, the defendants engaged in drug trafficking while using a firearm. Both defendants received an additional five-year sentence for using or carrying a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime pursuant to 18 U.S.C \u00a7 924(c)(1)A), even though they received longer mandatory minimum sentences under the Armed Career Criminal Act. On appeal, they argued that the sentencing enhancement provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)A) should run concurrently with their already longer minimum sentences. The Third and Fifth Circuits rejected the defendants' arguments.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Yes. In its first opinion of the term, a unanimous Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' opinions. \"A defendant is subject to the highest mandatory minimum specified for his conduct in \u00a7924(c), unless another provision of law directed to conduct proscribed by \u00a7924(c) imposes an even greater mandatory minimum,\" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in an 8-0 opinion. Justice Elena Kagan did not take part in the decision because of her involvement in the case as the solicitor general.</p>\n"
