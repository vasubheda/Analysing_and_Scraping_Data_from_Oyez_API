    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Noah Duguid brought this lawsuit because Facebook sent him numerous automatic text messages without his consent. Duguid did not use Facebook, yet for approximately ten months, the social media company repeatedly alerted him by text message that someone was attempting to access his (nonexistent) Facebook account.</p>\n<p>Duguid sued Facebook for violating a provision of the Telephone and Consumer Protection Act of 1991 that forbids calls placed using an automated telephone dialing system (\u201cATDS\u201d), or autodialer. Facebook moved to dismiss Duguid\u2019s claims for two alternate reasons. Of relevance here, Facebook argued that the equipment it used to send text messages to Duguid is not an ATDS within the meaning of the statute. The district court dismissed the claim, and a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding Facebook\u2019s equipment plausibly falls within the definition of an ATDS. TCPA defines an ATDS as a device with the capacity \u201cto store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator.\u201d Ninth Circuit precedent further clarifies that an ATDS \u201cneed not be able to use a random or sequential generator to store numbers,\u201d only that it \u201chave the capacity to store numbers to be called and to dial such numbers automatically.\u201d</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>Under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, to qualify as an \u201cautomatic telephone dialing system,\u201d a device must have the capacity either to store or to produce a telephone number using a random or sequential number generator. Justice Sonia Sotomayor authored the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Section 227(a)(1) defines an autodialer as \u201cequipment which has the capacity...to store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator; and to dial such numbers.\u201d Contrary to Duguid\u2019s contention, the clause \u201cusing a random or sequential number generator\u201d modifies both verbs to \u201cstore\u201d and to \u201cproduce\u201d telephone numbers. Because Facebook\u2019s notification system neither stores nor produces numbers \u201cusing a random or sequential number generator,\u201d it is not an autodialer.</p>\n<p>Justice Samuel Alito filed an opinion concurring in the judgment to caution about the majority\u2019s overreliance on a canon of statutory construction, that \u201cwhen there is a straightforward, parallel construction that involves all nouns or verbs in a series,\u2019 a modifier at the end of the list \u2018normally applies to the entire series.\u2019\u201d</p>\n"
