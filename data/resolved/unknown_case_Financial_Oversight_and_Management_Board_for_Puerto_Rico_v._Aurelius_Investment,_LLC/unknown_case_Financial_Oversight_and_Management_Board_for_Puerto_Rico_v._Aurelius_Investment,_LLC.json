    "description": "A group of cases in which the Court will decide the constitutionality of President Barack Obama\u2019s appointments (without their being confirmed by the Senate) to the oversight board created to help Puerto Rico recover from its substantial indebtedness.",

    "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Since it was ceded to the United States in 1898, Puerto Rico has accumulated substantial debt, in large part due to its ambiguous legal status as a protectorate of the United States and the economically detrimental policies the United States has enacted over the decades. Exacerbated by a series of governmental financial deficits and a recession, Puerto Rico\u2019s debt crisis came to a head in 2015, when its governor announced that the Commonwealth was in a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d and was unable to pay its debt. In June 2016, President Barack Obama signed into law the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act of 2016 (PROMESA), which gave him authority to appoint a seven-member Financial Oversight and Management Board that would have control over Puerto Rico\u2019s budget and would negotiate the restructuring of its $125 billion indebtedness. President Obama appointed the seven-member board in August 2016 based on lists supplied by Republic and Democratic lawmakers.</p>\n<p>A number of creditors and elected officials of Puerto Rico have been dissatisfied with the board and its decisions and brought a lawsuit challenging President Obama\u2019s authority to appoint the board members. The challengers alleged that the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires that the Senate confirm high-level federal officers and that the board members were within the scope of this Clause. The federal district court in Puerto Rico ruled against the creditors, finding the board is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth government established pursuant to Congress\u2019s plenary powers under the Territorial Clause and that the board members are not \u201cOfficers of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed, concluding that the Territorial Clause does not supersede the application of the Appointments Clause in an unincorporated territory and that the board members are \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d because: (1) they occupy \u201ccontinuing positions,\u201d (2) exercise \u201csignificant authority\u201d that is the same or more than that exercised by other officers the U.S. Supreme Court has found to be \u201cOfficers of the United States,\u201d and (3) exercise their authority \u201cpursuant to the laws of the United States.\u201d Moreover, these officers are \u201cprincipal\u201d officers subject to the Appointments Clause because they are answerable to and removable only by the President and are not directed or supervised by others who were appointed by the President with Senate confirmation.</p>\n",
    "conclusion": "<p>The Appointments Clause constrains the appointments power as to all officers of the United States, including those who exercise power in or in relation to Puerto Rico, but the Clause does not restrict the appointment or selection of the members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board. Based on this conclusion, the Court had no reason to address the second question presented. Justice Stephen Breyer authored the opinion of the Court that was unanimous in the judgment.</p>\n<p>The Appointments Clause of the federal Constitution is intended to allocate between the President and the Senate responsibility for selecting officers to hold high federal positions. Because of this purpose, the Appointments Clause should apply to all officers of the United States, even those with powers and duties related to Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>However, the Appointments Clause does not restrict the appointment of local officers that Congress vests with primarily local duties. When an officer has primarily local duties, he is not an officer of the United States within the meaning of the Appointments Clause. The Board members have primarily local powers and duties, exemplified by the fact that the power of the Board is backed by Puerto Rico law rather than federal law. Indeed, the Board\u2019s duty is to oversee the fiscal and budgetary development of Puerto Rico and to initiate bankruptcy proceedings in the interests of Puerto Rico. Consequently, the Appointments Clause does not constrain the appointments power as to the Board members.</p>\n<p>Justice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion concurring in the judgment but based on interpretation of the \u201coriginal public meaning\u201d of the phrase \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d within the Appointments Clause.</p>\n<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed an opinion concurring in the judgment to explore issues the Court did not (and did not need) to address regarding the relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States. Specifically, Justice Sotomayor pointed out that the history of that relationship calls into question whether the Board members may be territorial officers of Puerto Rico when \u201cthey are not elected or approved, directly or indirectly, by the people of Puerto Rico.\u201d</p>\n"
